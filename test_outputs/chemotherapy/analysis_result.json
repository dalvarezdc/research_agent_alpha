Participants were patients with cancer at 2 Alabama-based academic institutions receiving chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy; the exposure group received standard-of-care delivered RSM from 2021 to 2024, and historical controls were patients who received cancer treatment prior to RSM implementation from 2017 to 2021. Data were analyzed from May to October 2024. [...] ### Affiliations\n\n## Abstract\n\nImportance:\nValue-based health care increasingly requires electronic patient-reported outcome-based remote symptom monitoring (RSM) to improve health care utilization in patients with cancer. However, data on the impact of RSM in clinical practice are lacking.\n\nObjective:\nTo evaluate the association of RSM with 3- and 6-month health care utilization among patients receiving systemic cancer treatment.",

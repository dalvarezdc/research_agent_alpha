## 📋 Medication Overview
**Name:** lactoferrin
**Drug Class:** Lactoferrin is classified as an iron-binding glycoprotein and immunomodulatory agent. Therapeutically, it functions as a nutritional supplement, antimicrobial protein, and immunomodulator. It belongs to the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins.
**Analysis Confidence:** 0.75/1.00

## 🧬 Mechanism of Action
Lactoferrin exerts multiple mechanisms at the molecular level: (1) Iron sequestration - binds ferric iron (Fe3+) with high affinity (Kd ~10^-20 M), depriving pathogens of essential iron for growth; (2) Direct antimicrobial activity - binds to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on bacterial membranes causing ...

## ⚗️ Pharmacokinetics Summary
- **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability of intact lactoferrin is low (approximately 1-5% in adults) due to gastric acid...
- **Metabolism:** Lactoferrin undergoes proteolytic degradation by pepsin in the stomach and pancreatic proteases (try...
- **Elimination:** Primary route of elimination is through gastrointestinal degradation and fecal excretion of unabsorb...
- **Half-Life:** The elimination half-life of orally administered lactoferrin is approximately 2-4 hours for detectable peptide fragments in plasma. For intact lactoferrin following intravenous administration in animal studies, the half-life ranges from 5-15 minutes due to rapid hepatic uptake and tissue distribution. Biological activity in the gastrointestinal tract persists for 6-12 hours post-administration due to gradual proteolytic degradation and local effects.

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 00:00:05
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: ### Core Position
- **Disease Model**: MS is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks myelin sheaths in the CNS
- **Treatment Paradigm**: Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) to suppress im...
- Counter Narrative: **The Metabolic/Mitochondrial Hypothesis:**
- MS may be primarily a **neurodegenerative energy crisis** with secondary immune involvement
- Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons and oligodendrocytes pr...
- Key Conflicts: - Recent data: Vitamin D levels inversely correlate with MS activity (multiple observational studies 2015-2023)
**Dietary Interventions:**
*Wahls Protocol (Terry Wahls, MD - MS patient):*
- Paleo-styl...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 00:03:06
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: ### The Disease is Misnamed
MS is **not primarily autoimmune** in the classical sense. The evidence points to:
**A Multi-Hit Neurodegenerative Process:**
1. **EBV infection** (necessary cause - 32x ri...
- Industry Bias: ### The DMT Paradigm Lock-In
**What DMTs Actually Do:**
- ✅ Suppress inflammatory relapses (30-70% reduction)
- ✅ Reduce MRI lesions (surrogate marker)
- ❌ Modest effect on long-term disability (the o...
- Grey Zone: - **EBV is ancient**, but modern immune systems lack calibration from:
  - Helminths (removed in 20th century)
  - Adequate vitamin D (indoor lifestyle)
  - Metabolic flexibility (constant feeding vs....

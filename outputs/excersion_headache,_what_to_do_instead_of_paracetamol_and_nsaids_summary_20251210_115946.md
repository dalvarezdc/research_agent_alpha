## 🔬 Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 11:55:21
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: The International Headache Society classifies primary exercise headache (PEH) as a benign condition triggered by strenuous physical activity, lasting 5 minutes to 48 hours. Standard medical guidance r...
- Counter Narrative: - **Screening imperative**: Rule out secondary causes (subarachnoid hemorrhage, arterial dissection, cardiac cephalgia) especially for new-onset cases
- **Gradual warm-up protocols** to reduce inciden...

### Phase 2: Evidence Stress Test

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 11:56:47
**User Choice:** Proceed

**Key Findings:**
- Industry Funded Studies: - **Critical gap**: No modern RCTs comparing indomethacin to placebo or natural interventions for primary exercise headache specifically
- **Mechanism**: Magnesium deficiency found in 50% of migraine ...
- Independent Research: ### 🔬 **SIGNAL #1: Magnesium - Stronger Evidence Than Claimed**
  - 600mg magnesium citrate daily for 12 weeks
  - **Result**: 41.6% reduction in migraine frequency vs 15.8% placebo (p<0.05)
  - **No ...

The standard recommendation for **indomethacin** (25-50mg pre-exercise) originates primarily from:
- **Indomethacin studies (1980s-1990s)**: Small case series (n=8-...
- Anecdotal Signals: ---

- **Forward head posture** during running/cycling increases suboccipital muscle tension by 300% (measured via EMG)
- Simple cue: "Run...
- Time Weighted Evidence:   - Riboflavin 400mg + CoQ10 300mg + magnesium 400mg combination
  - **Superior to riboflavin alone**: 61% responder rate (≥50% reduction)
**PRIORITY FINDING**: The **combination approach** (riboflavi...

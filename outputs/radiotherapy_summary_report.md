## 📋 PROCEDURE INFORMATION

### What is Radiotherapy?

Radiotherapy (radiation therapy) uses high-energy radiation beams to damage cancer cell DNA, preventing their growth and division. It can be delivered externally via linear accelerators or internally through brachytherapy. Treatment is typically fractionated over several weeks to maximize cancer cell kill while allowing normal tissue recovery. Modern techniques like IMRT and IGRT improve precision and reduce side effects.

### 🎯 Medical Conditions Treated

Cancer treatment (primary or adjuvant), tumor shrinkage before surgery, palliative care for pain/symptoms, benign conditions like keloids and arteriovenous malformations in select cases.

### ⚠️ Patients at Special Risk / Contraindications

Pregnancy (absolute), previous radiation to same area (relative), active lupus or scleroderma, severe immunosuppression, life expectancy under 6 months for curative intent, inability to lie still during treatment.

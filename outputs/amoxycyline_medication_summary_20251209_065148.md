## Mechanism of Action
Amoxicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically PBP1a, PBP1b, PBP2, and PBP3. This binding prevents the transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. The drug interferes with the cross-linking of peptidogly...

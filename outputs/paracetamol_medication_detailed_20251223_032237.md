## 📋 Overview

### 🧬 Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic (p-aminophenol derivative)

### 🔬 Mechanism of Action
Exact mechanism not fully elucidated. Primarily inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, possibly a COX-3 variant, reducing prostaglandin E2 synthesis and hypothalamic fever response. Weak peripheral COX-1/COX-2 inhibition. Additional actions include activation of descending serotonergic inhibitory pathways, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) modulation, and inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), enhancing endocannabinoid signaling.

## ⚗️ Pharmacology

### Absorption
Rapidly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract; oral bioavailability 70-90%; onset of analgesia 15-60 minutes; peak plasma concentration 0.5-2 hours.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Hepatic phase II conjugation predominant: glucuronidation (50-60%), sulfation (25-35%); minor CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 oxidation to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), detoxified by glutathione.

### Elimination
Primarily renal excretion of metabolites (90-100% within 24 hours); <5% excreted unchanged in urine.

**Half-Life:** 1.5-3 hours in adults (prolonged to 4-8 hours in hepatic impairment or neonates).

## 💉 Clinical Use

### Approved Indications
1. Relief of mild to moderate pain
2. Reduction of fever

### Off-Label Uses
1. Postoperative pain (intravenous formulation)
2. Osteoarthritis pain
3. Headache and migraine
4. Dysmenorrhea

### Standard Dosing
Adults: 500-1000 mg orally or rectally every 4-6 hours as needed; maximum 4000 mg/day. Children (≥2 years): 10-15 mg/kg/dose every 4-6 hours; maximum 75 mg/kg/day (not exceeding adult maximum).

### Dose Adjustments
**Renal Impairment:**
CrCl 10-50 mL/min: every 6 hours; CrCl <10 mL/min or hemodialysis: every 8 hours; maximum 3000 mg/day.

**Hepatic Impairment:**
Mild-moderate: maximum 3000 mg/day; severe (Child-Pugh C): avoid or maximum 2000 mg/day with close monitoring.

## 🔗 Interactions

### 💊 Drug-Drug Interactions

#### 🔴 Ethanol (chronic heavy use) (SEVERE)

**Mechanism:** PK: Induction of CYP2E1, increasing toxic NAPQI metabolite formation

**Clinical Effect:** Hepatotoxicity, potentially fulminant liver failure

**Management:** Avoid concurrent use; if necessary, use minimal effective paracetamol dose and monitor LFTs closely

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Warfarin (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** PD/PK: Possible inhibition of warfarin metabolism or enhanced anticoagulant effect

**Clinical Effect:** Elevated INR, increased bleeding risk

**Management:** Monitor INR frequently, particularly with high-dose or prolonged paracetamol use

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Lamotrigine (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** PK: Paracetamol induces lamotrigine glucuronidation

**Clinical Effect:** Decreased lamotrigine plasma concentrations, reduced efficacy

**Management:** Monitor lamotrigine levels and clinical response; titrate dose as needed

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Probenecid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** PK: Inhibits renal excretion and glucuronidation of paracetamol

**Clinical Effect:** Increased paracetamol exposure, risk of toxicity

**Management:** Monitor for hepatotoxicity; consider paracetamol dose reduction

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Isoniazid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** PK/PD: Additive hepatotoxicity; possible CYP2E1 induction

**Clinical Effect:** Elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity

**Management:** Monitor LFTs regularly

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟢 Metoclopramide (MINOR)

**Mechanism:** PK: Enhanced gastric emptying accelerates absorption

**Clinical Effect:** Faster onset of action, no change in overall exposure

**Management:** No dose adjustment required

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟢 Cholestyramine (MINOR)

**Mechanism:** PK: Physical binding in gastrointestinal tract

**Clinical Effect:** Reduced paracetamol absorption if co-administered

**Management:** Administer paracetamol at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after cholestyramine

**Time Separation:** 1 hour before or 4 hours after

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟢 Activated charcoal (MINOR)

**Mechanism:** PK: Adsorption in gastrointestinal tract

**Clinical Effect:** Decreased paracetamol bioavailability

**Management:** Separate administration by at least 1 hour

**Time Separation:** 1 hour

**Evidence Level:** moderate

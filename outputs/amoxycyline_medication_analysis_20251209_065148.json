  "medication_name": "amoxycyline",
  "drug_class": "Pharmacologic class: Aminopenicillin, beta-lactam antibiotic. Therapeutic class: Antibacterial agent with activity against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.",
  "mechanism_of_action": "Amoxicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically PBP1a, PBP1b, PBP2, and PBP3. This binding prevents the transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. The drug interferes with the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains, which are essential for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This leads to cell wall weakening, osmotic instability, cell lysis, and bacterial death. Amoxicillin is bactericidal and most effective against actively dividing bacteria. It is susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes produced by resistant bacteria.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Oral bioavailability: approximately 74-92% (well absorbed from GI tract). Absorption is not significantly affected by food. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur at 1-2 hours after oral administration. For a 500 mg dose, Cmax is approximately 7-8 mcg/mL. Onset of action occurs within 1-2 hours. Absorption is more complete than ampicillin due to better acid stability.",
    "metabolism": "Minimal hepatic metabolism. Approximately 10-25% of amoxicillin is metabolized in the liver to inactive penicilloic acid metabolites. Does not undergo significant CYP450-mediated metabolism. Most of the drug is excreted unchanged.",
    "elimination": "Primary route: Renal excretion. Approximately 60-80% excreted unchanged in urine within 6-8 hours via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Small amounts eliminated in feces (10-25%). Probenecid decreases renal tubular secretion and increases serum concentrations. Removed by hemodialysis (approximately 50% in 3-4 hours).",
    "half_life": "1-1.5 hours in patients with normal renal function. Increases to 7-20 hours in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <10 mL/min). Neonates: 3-4 hours. Infants and children: 1-2 hours."

For severe infections or difficult-to-treat organisms: 875 mg every 12 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours.

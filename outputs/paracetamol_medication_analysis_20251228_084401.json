  "medication_name": "Paracetamol",
  "drug_class": "Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic",
  "mechanism_of_action": "Paracetamol primarily exerts its effects centrally by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-3) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis in the brain and spinal cord, which accounts for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory activity due to negligible inhibition of COX-2 at therapeutic doses. Additional mechanisms may involve activation of descending inhibitory serotonergic pathways and modulation of the endocannabinoid system.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Paracetamol is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed from the small intestine following oral administration, with bioavailability of 70-90% attributable to first-pass hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma concentrations occur within 0.5-2 hours post-dose. Food may delay absorption by 0.5-1 hour but does not significantly alter overall exposure.",
    "metabolism": "Hepatic metabolism predominates via three main pathways: glucuronidation (50-60%), sulfation (25-35%), and minor CYP2E1-mediated oxidation (5-10%) to the reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is rapidly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione under normal conditions. In overdose or glutathione depletion, NAPQI accumulation causes centrilobular hepatotoxicity.",
    "elimination": "Primarily renal excretion of inactive metabolites (glucuronide and sulfate conjugates account for >90% of dose). Less than 5% is eliminated unchanged in urine. Total body clearance is approximately 300-500 mL/min in adults, with half-life influencing dosing intervals.",
    "half_life": "1.5-3 hours in healthy adults; extended to 5-8 hours in hepatic impairment, up to 10 hours in neonates, and 3-4 hours in renal impairment."

## Overview

### Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Tetracycline antibiotic; Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent

### Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex at the acceptor (A) site. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Doxycycline also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), phospholipase A2, and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It chelates metal ions (calcium, magnesium, iron) which contributes to its antimicrobial activity and some adverse effects.

## Pharmacology

### Absorption
Oral bioavailability: 90-100% (nearly complete absorption). Absorption is minimally affected by food or milk (unlike other tetracyclines). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur at 2-3 hours after oral administration. Cmax values range from 1.5-3.5 mcg/mL after a 100 mg dose. Absorption occurs primarily in the stomach and upper small intestine.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Minimal hepatic metabolism. Unlike other tetracyclines, doxycycline does not undergo significant metabolism by CYP450 enzymes. Small amounts may be metabolized to inactive metabolites. Does not produce clinically significant active metabolites. Enterohepatic recirculation occurs, contributing to prolonged half-life.

### Elimination
Primary route: Fecal elimination (20-40% as active drug) via biliary excretion and direct intestinal secretion. Renal elimination: 20-40% excreted unchanged in urine via glomerular filtration. Total body clearance: 1.5-2.5 L/hour. Elimination is not significantly affected by renal impairment, making it the tetracycline of choice in patients with renal dysfunction.

**Half-Life:** 15-25 hours (average 18-22 hours) in adults with normal renal and hepatic function. Half-life may be prolonged to 20-30 hours in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

### Standard Dosing
Adults: Initial dose: 200 mg on day 1 (given as 100 mg every 12 hours or 200 mg once daily), followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg once daily or 100 mg every 12 hours for more severe infections. For acute infections: 100 mg every 12 hours. For acne: 50-100 mg once or twice daily. For malaria prophylaxis: 100 mg once daily starting 1-2 days before travel, continuing during travel, and for 4 weeks after leaving endemic area. For anthrax post-exposure prophylaxis: 100 mg twice daily for 60 days. Subantimicrobial dose for periodontitis: 20 mg twice daily. Maximum dose: 200 mg/day for most indications. Pediatric (>8 years, >45 kg): Same as adult dosing. Pediatric (<45 kg): 2-4 mg/kg/day divided every 12-24 hours (maximum 200 mg/day).

### Dose Adjustments
**Renal Impairment:**
No dose adjustment required for any degree of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Doxycycline is the preferred tetracycline in renal failure due to predominantly non-renal elimination.

**Hepatic Impairment:**
Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment. Consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval in severe hepatic dysfunction, though specific recommendations are not well established. Monitor for increased adverse effects. Half-life may be prolonged.

**Elderly:**
No specific dose adjustment required based on age alone. However, consider age-related decline in renal and hepatic function when prescribing.

**Pregnancy:**
Pregnancy Category D. Contraindicated in pregnancy, especially after first trimester, due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration, enamel hypoplasia, and inhibition of bone growth in the fetus. Use only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus.

**Pediatric Considerations:**
Generally avoided in children <8 years of age due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia. However, may be used for serious infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever) when benefits outweigh risks. For children ≥8 years: dose based on weight as noted in standard dosing.

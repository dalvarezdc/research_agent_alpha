34. Patient comorbidity profile
35. Organ function tests (renal, hepatic, cardiac)
36. Previous chemotherapy exposure and toxicities
37. Local formulary and regimen preferences
38. Supportive care protocols
39. Monitoring schedules and dose modification guidelines
40. Recommendation:** Chemotherapy is appropriate for lung cancer under proper medical supervision, but specific regimen selection requires comprehensive patient evaluation and current guideline consultation.

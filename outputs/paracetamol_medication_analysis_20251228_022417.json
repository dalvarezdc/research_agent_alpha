  "medication_name": "Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)",
  "drug_class": "Miscellaneous analgesics (non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic)",
  "mechanism_of_action": "The precise mechanism is not fully understood. Paracetamol is believed to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system and work peripherally to block pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis through action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center. Unlike NSAIDs, it does not significantly reduce peripheral inflammation.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Rapidly absorbed by passive diffusion in the small intestine with approximately 80% bioavailability. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 18 mg/L (120 \u00b5M) is reached following standard therapeutic dosing. Moderately lipid-soluble (pKa 9.5), enabling rapid cellular membrane penetration and blood-brain barrier crossing.",
    "metabolism": "Primarily hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation and sulfation pathways. A small proportion is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4) to form the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is normally detoxified by hepatic glutathione conjugation.",
    "elimination": "Primarily renal excretion of metabolites. Less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine.",
    "half_life": "Approximately 2-3 hours in adults with normal hepatic and renal function"

    "standard_dosing": "Adults: 500-1000 mg (1-2 tablets of 500 mg) orally every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 4000 mg (8 tablets of 500 mg) in 24 hours. Pediatric dosing: Age-dependent ranging from 60 mg (2-3 months) to 480-750 mg (12-16 years). Available formulations include oral tablets, capsules, soluble/chewable tablets, oral suspension, suppositories, and intravenous infusion.",

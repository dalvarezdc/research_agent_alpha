[...] Paracetamol is the Australian Approved Name and the British Approved Name as well as the international nonproprietary name that is used by the World Health Organization (WHO); acetaminophen is the United States Adopted Name and the Japanese Accepted Name. Both paracetamol and acetaminophen are contractions of chemical names for the compound. The word paracetamol is a shortened form of para-acetylaminophenol, and was coined by Frederick Stearns & Co in 1956, while the word acetaminophen is a [...] Paracetamol was first made in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse or possibly in 1852 by Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt. It is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in both the United States and Europe. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

It is commonly included as an ingredient in cold and flu medications and is also used on its own. [...] Paracetamol is exactly the same drug as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Paracetamol is the drug's name assigned using the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) generic name system.

(pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) - of paracetamol. Paracetamol is a moderately lipid-soluble weak organic acid with a pka value of 9.5 and is largely un-ionized over the physiological range of pH . Its lipid solubility enables it to rapidly penetrate cellular membranes and to also readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed by passive diffusion in the small intestine . A standard therapeutic dose of paracetamol produces 80% bioavailability and reaches peak plasma level (Cmax) of 18 mg/L (120 \u00b5M) after [...] The standard therapeutic dose of paracetamol for adults is 2 tablets of 500 mg each taken orally every 4 hours up to a maximum of 8 tablets for any 24-hour period. In children, paracetamol is marketed in dosages depending on age and range from 60 mg (2\u20133 months) to 480\u2013750 mg (12\u201316 year olds). Paracetamol is sold as a single pharmacologically active chemical entity or in formulations in combination with other analgesic drugs that include aspirin, caffeine or some opioid analgesic drugs [...] As a widely available over-the-counter drug, paracetamol is known to be used for purposes other than for its analgesic and antipyretic actions. This include the use of paracetamol for the induction of sleep, which is based on anecdotal personal experiences .

## 🔬 Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-04 20:17:57
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: The official narrative for improving bone health focuses on achieving and maintaining peak bone mass through lifelong strategies including adequate dietary calcium intake of 1,000-1,200 mg/day from da...
- Counter Narrative: Counter narratives emphasize cofactor nutrients beyond calcium, such as vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 at 100-180 mcg/day) to direct calcium into bones and prevent arterial calcification, magnesium (320-42...
- Key Conflicts: Primary conflicts center on calcium supplementation efficacy (official: reduces fracture risk by 10-20%; counter: neutral or increased cardiovascular risk per trials like Women's Health Initiative, wi...

### Phase 2: Evidence Stress Test

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-04 20:18:19
**User Choice:** Proceed

**Key Findings:**
- Industry Funded Studies: Industry-funded studies from pharmaceutical giants like Merck (alendronate) and Amgen (denosumab) provide high-level evidence through large RCTs such as the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT, n=6,459 p...
- Independent Research: Independent academic and NIH-funded meta-analyses (e.g., Cochrane reviews) confirm weight-bearing exercises (walking/jogging 30 min/day, 5 days/week) plus resistance training (2-3 sessions/week at 70-...
- Methodology Quality: Official narrative boasts gold-standard evidence from double-blind RCTs (n>5,000, low heterogeneity, GRADE A) for bisphosphonates (e.g., 44-70% relative fracture risk reduction) and DXA-guided screeni...
- Anecdotal Signals: Patient communities (e.g., Inspire, Reddit r/osteoporosis) report DXA improvements (0.5-1.5 T-score gains) after 6-12 months of K2 (100-180 mcg/day MK-7) + magnesium (400 mg/day), often with reduced a...
- Time Weighted Evidence: Pre-2000 evidence overwhelmingly supported official calcium/vitamin D (1,000-1,200 mg + 600-800 IU) and bisphosphonates for peak bone mass and fracture prevention (e.g., 1990s RCTs), weighted heavily ...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-04 20:18:30
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: Achieving and maintaining peak bone mass requires lifelong adequate calcium intake (1,000-1,200 mg/day from diet or supplements), vitamin D (600-2,000 IU/day or equivalent sunlight exposure of 15-30 m...
- Industry Bias: Pharmaceutical industry (e.g., Merck, Amgen) funds large RCTs like FIT (n=6,459, alendronate 47-51% fracture reduction) and promotes denosumab/bisphosphonates as first-line for osteoporosis, emphasizi...
- Grey Zone: Calcium supplementation efficacy is debated: official narrative claims 10-20% fracture risk reduction with 1,000-1,200 mg/day + vitamin D, but counter cites neutral/increased CV risk (e.g., WHI high-d...

**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: **Disease Model**: MS is characterized as an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks myelin sheaths in the CNS, causing demyelination and neurodegeneration. Treatment focuses on immune sup...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 01:47:40
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: ### The Disease is Likely Misclassified
**MS appears to be a post-infectious metabolic crisis, not a primary autoimmune disease.**
**Core Evidence:**
- **EBV causality is now undeniable**: Bjornevik e...
- Industry Bias: **Tier 2 - Moderate Evidence, High Safety:**
4. **Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA 2-4g/day)**
   - Membrane stabilization, reduced inflammation
   - Multiple small trials show benefit
5. **Helminthic the...
- Grey Zone: 3. **Developed nation clustering** = processed food/microbiome disruption
4. **EBV ubiquity without universal MS** = requires additional metabolic vulnerability

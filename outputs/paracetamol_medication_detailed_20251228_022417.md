## 📋 Overview

### 🧬 Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Miscellaneous analgesics (non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic)

### 🔬 Mechanism of Action
The precise mechanism is not fully understood. Paracetamol is believed to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system and work peripherally to block pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis through action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center. Unlike NSAIDs, it does not significantly reduce peripheral inflammation.

## ⚗️ Pharmacology

### Absorption
Rapidly absorbed by passive diffusion in the small intestine with approximately 80% bioavailability. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 18 mg/L (120 µM) is reached following standard therapeutic dosing. Moderately lipid-soluble (pKa 9.5), enabling rapid cellular membrane penetration and blood-brain barrier crossing.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Primarily hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation and sulfation pathways. A small proportion is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4) to form the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is normally detoxified by hepatic glutathione conjugation.

### Elimination
Primarily renal excretion of metabolites. Less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine.

**Half-Life:** Approximately 2-3 hours in adults with normal hepatic and renal function

---

## 💉 Clinical Use

### Approved Indications
1. Mild to moderate pain relief
2. Fever reduction (antipyretic)
3. Headache
4. Cold and flu symptoms (in combination formulations)
5. Moderate to severe pain (in combination with opioid analgesics such as codeine)

### Off-Label Uses
1. Sleep induction (anecdotal use without clinical evidence support)

### Standard Dosing
Adults: 500-1000 mg (1-2 tablets of 500 mg) orally every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 4000 mg (8 tablets of 500 mg) in 24 hours. Pediatric dosing: Age-dependent ranging from 60 mg (2-3 months) to 480-750 mg (12-16 years). Available formulations include oral tablets, capsules, soluble/chewable tablets, oral suspension, suppositories, and intravenous infusion.

### Dose Adjustments
**Hepatic Impairment:**
Reduce dose and extend dosing interval. Use with extreme caution or avoid in severe hepatic impairment

**Renal Impairment:**
Extend dosing interval in moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min)

**Chronic Alcohol Use:**
Reduce maximum daily dose to 2000 mg due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity

**Malnutrition:**
Use with caution due to depleted glutathione stores increasing hepatotoxicity risk

**Elderly:**
Consider dose reduction and extended intervals due to altered pharmacokinetics

## 🔗 Interactions

### 💊 Drug-Drug Interactions

#### 🟡 Warfarin (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Chronic paracetamol use may enhance anticoagulant effect through unknown mechanism

**Clinical Effect:** Increased INR and bleeding risk with prolonged use (>1-2 weeks) of regular paracetamol doses

**Management:** Monitor INR more frequently if paracetamol used regularly. Occasional use unlikely to be clinically significant.

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🔴 Chronic alcohol consumption (SEVERE)

**Mechanism:** Chronic alcohol induces CYP2E1, increasing formation of toxic NAPQI metabolite. Alcohol may also deplete hepatic glutathione stores.

**Clinical Effect:** Significantly increased risk of hepatotoxicity even at therapeutic doses

**Management:** Limit maximum daily dose to 2000 mg. Counsel patients on risks. Consider alternative analgesics.

**Evidence Level:** high


#### 🟡 Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital (enzyme inducers) (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Induction of CYP450 enzymes increases formation of toxic NAPQI metabolite

**Clinical Effect:** Increased risk of hepatotoxicity, reduced analgesic efficacy

**Management:** Use with caution. Consider dose reduction or alternative analgesic. Monitor liver function.

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Isoniazid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** May increase formation of toxic metabolites

**Clinical Effect:** Increased hepatotoxicity risk

**Management:** Monitor liver function. Use lowest effective dose.

**Evidence Level:** moderate

### 🍎 Food & Lifestyle Interactions

#### Food (general)

**Mechanism:** Food may delay absorption but does not significantly affect total bioavailability

**Clinical Effect:** Delayed time to peak concentration but similar overall effect

**Management:** May be taken with or without food. Take with food if gastric upset occurs.

#### Chronic alcohol consumption

**Mechanism:** Chronic alcohol depletes glutathione stores and induces CYP2E1

**Clinical Effect:** Markedly increased hepatotoxicity risk

**Management:** Limit paracetamol dose to maximum 2000 mg daily. Avoid regular use in chronic alcohol consumers.

### Environmental Considerations

- Paracetamol is detected in surface waters and wastewater as an environmental contaminant
- Proper disposal of unused medication recommended through pharmacy take-back programs
- Do not flush down toilet or pour down drain unless specifically instructed

## ⚠️ Safety Profile

### 🚨 BLACK BOX WARNINGS

1. Hepatotoxicity: Risk of severe liver damage and acute liver failure with overdose. Maximum daily dose must not exceed 4000 mg in adults. Paracetamol is the leading cause of acute liver failure in Western countries and responsible for approximately 50 deaths annually in Australia.

2. Combination products: Patients must be aware of paracetamol content in combination products to avoid unintentional overdose from multiple sources.

### Adverse Effects

**Common (>10%):**
- Generally well-tolerated at therapeutic doses
- Nausea (uncommon)
- Rash (uncommon)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (rare)

**Serious (Any Frequency):**
- Acute liver failure (most common cause in Western countries)
- Hepatotoxicity with overdose or chronic excessive use
- Acute tubular necrosis (renal failure)
- Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis - rare)
- Blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis - rare)
- Anaphylaxis (rare)

### Contraindications

**Severe hepatic impairment** (N/A)
- Reason: N/A

**Known hypersensitivity to paracetamol/acetaminophen** (N/A)
- Reason: N/A

**Active liver disease** (N/A)
- Reason: N/A

### Warning Signs

**Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite** (N/A)
- Action: May indicate hepatotoxicity. Discontinue immediately and seek medical evaluation. Check liver function tests.

**Jaundice, dark urine, pale stools** (N/A)
- Action: Indicates liver injury. Seek immediate medical attention. Discontinue paracetamol.

**Unusual bleeding or bruising** (N/A)
- Action: May indicate blood dyscrasia or liver dysfunction. Seek medical evaluation immediately.

**Severe skin rash, blistering, or peeling** (N/A)
- Action: May indicate serious hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue immediately and seek emergency medical care.

**Suspected overdose (>4000 mg in 24 hours or >150 mg/kg in children)** (N/A)
- Action: Medical emergency. Seek immediate emergency care. N-acetylcysteine antidote may be required within 8-24 hours.

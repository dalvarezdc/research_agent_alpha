## 🔬 Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 11:53:05
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: **Position Statement:**
- **Protein sufficiency through diet alone** (0.8-1.6g/kg bodyweight)
- **Creatine monohydrate** as the only supplement with robust evidence (ISSN position: safe and effective)...
- Counter Narrative: **Core Thesis:**
**A. Protein Requirements Are Systematically Underestimated**
- Morton et al. (2018) meta-analysis in *British Journal of Sports Medicine* found 1.6g/kg is the lower threshold for tra...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 11:56:16
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: ### **The Ancestral Mismatch Framework**
Modern muscle-building occurs in a biochemically hostile environment our genes never encountered:
**Environmental Stressors (Unaccounted in Official Guidelines...
- Industry Bias: - **Distortion**: Overemphasis on whey timing ("anabolic window")
  - 2013-2017 studies (Glanbia-funded) claimed 30-min post-workout window
**D. Pharmaceutical Suppression of Nutraceuticals**
- **Patt...
- Grey Zone: ### **Tier 3A: Strong Mechanism, Weak Human Data**
**1. Boron (6-9mg/day)**
- **Evidence**: Naghii et al. (2011): 28% free testosterone increase in 1 week (n=8)

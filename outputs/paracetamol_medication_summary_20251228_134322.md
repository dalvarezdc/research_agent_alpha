## 📋 Medication Overview
**Name:** Paracetamol
**Drug Class:** Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic
**Analysis Confidence:** 0.95/1.00

## 🧬 Mechanism of Action
Paracetamol selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-2) more than COX-1 in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby mediating analgesic and antipyretic effects. It exhibits weak peripheral anti-inflammatory activity compared to NSAIDs. The exact central mechanism may ...

- **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism occurs via phase II conjugation: 50-60% to paracetamol-glucuronide, 25-...
- **Elimination:** Elimination is predominantly renal, with 90-100% of dose excreted as metabolites in urine within 24 ...

## 💡 Recommendations

### ✅ What TO DO:

1. **Educate on total intake from all sources (e.g., combination products).**
   - Reduces risk of hepatotoxicity based on pharmacokinetic data and overdose epidemiology....

2. **IV NAC 150 mg/kg over 1 hour, then 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours.**
   - Replenishes glutathione to detoxify NAPQI; Rumack-Matthew nomogram guides need....

3. **AUDIT-C questionnaire; cap at 2000 mg/day if positive.**
   - CYP2E1 induction increases NAPQI; limited evidence supports dose cap....

### ❌ What NOT TO DO:

1. **Do not combine multiple paracetamol-containing products without dose calculation.**

2. **Do not use long-term (>14 days) without LFT monitoring.**

3. **Do not administer to patients with G6PD deficiency routinely.**

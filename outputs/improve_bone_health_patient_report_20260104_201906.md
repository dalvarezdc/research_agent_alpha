# Simplified Guide to Improving Bone Health

## Executive Summary
Good bone health requires a combination of healthy eating, regular exercise, and lifestyle changes throughout life. Medicines are used only for people at very high risk. Building strong bones early involves getting enough calcium (1,000-1,200 mg per day), vitamin D (600-2,000 IU per day or safe sunlight exposure), and doing weight-bearing exercises like walking or lifting weights. These steps can increase bone mineral density (BMD, a measure of bone strength shown on scans) by 1.5-3% in the spine and hip over 12-24 months. Helpful extra nutrients include vitamin K2, magnesium, and boron, especially if you are low in them. For osteoporosis (diagnosed by a DXA scan T-score of -2.5 or lower, where bones are very weak), drugs like bisphosphonates lower fracture risk by 44-70% over 3-4 years. Get screened with a DXA scan (a low-radiation X-ray of bones) starting at age 65 for women and 70 for men. Large studies support these steps, but some funded by drug or supplement companies focus more on pills than lifestyle changes.

## Who Is at Risk and Why
Osteoporosis affects about 10% of people aged 50 and older worldwide. Postmenopausal women have the highest risk because dropping estrogen levels cause bone loss of 1-2% per year. Things you can change include low calcium or vitamin D intake (common in 40-50% of older adults), not exercising (raises fracture risk by 20-30%), smoking (speeds bone loss by 1-2% per decade of smoking), and drinking too much alcohol (more than 3 units per day increases hip fracture risk by 20%). Things you cannot change include getting older, being female, having a low body weight (BMI under 20 kg/m²), or family history (doubles your risk). Low levels of magnesium (seen in 50% of older adults) and vitamin K2 also weaken bones by affecting bone-building processes. Most fragility fractures (90%) happen from falls due to weak muscles or poor balance.

## Screening and Diagnosis
Get a DXA scan of your spine, hip, and forearm starting at age 65 for women or 70 for men, or earlier (ages 50-60) if at high risk, such as long-term steroid use (more than 3 months). A T-score of -2.5 or lower means osteoporosis; -1.0 to -2.5 means osteopenia (mild bone thinning). Use the FRAX tool (an online calculator) to combine your risks and predict 10-year fracture chance; treatment may start if major fracture risk is 20% or higher. Aim for blood vitamin D [25(OH)D] over 30 ng/mL. Check blood calcium, parathyroid hormone, and bone turnover markers like CTX. A DXA or spine X-ray can find hidden spine fractures in 20-30% of cases.

## Lifestyle Changes
### Exercise Plans
Do weight-bearing aerobic exercise like walking or jogging for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Add resistance training 2-3 times a week using weights at 70-80% of your maximum effort (1RM), working major muscles. This boosts bone-building cells, raises spine and hip BMD by 1.5-3% over 12-24 months, and cuts falls and fractures by 20-30%. High-impact moves like 50-100 jumps a day can increase hip BMD by 2-3% (evidence from smaller studies, rated GRADE B). Practice balance exercises like tai chi 2-3 times a week to reduce falls by 20-25%. Start slow (40-60% effort) if frail to prevent injury, and build up gradually.

### Other Habits
Quit smoking to stop extra bone loss and recover 1-2% BMD within 1 year. Limit alcohol to less than 3 units a day. Avoid long bed rest (more than 3 days causes 0.5-1% bone loss per week). Prevent falls by checking your home for hazards and getting vision checked.

## Nutrition Advice
### Main Nutrients
- **Calcium**: Aim for 1,000-1,200 mg daily from food like leafy greens or fortified items; use supplements if needed. Food is best. With vitamin D, supplements reduce fractures by 10-20% (strong evidence from large trials like WHI with 36,282 women, GRADE A), but some groups have neutral or higher heart risks (limited evidence, GRADE B). It works better with other nutrients.
- **Vitamin D**: Take 600-2,000 IU daily by mouth, or get sunlight on arms, legs, and face for 15-30 minutes midday, 3-5 times a week. This keeps blood levels over 30 ng/mL. Sunlight raises levels by 10-20 ng/mL naturally and is better than pills, but avoid over 4,000 IU supplements to prevent toxicity.

### Helpful Extra Nutrients
| Nutrient          | Recommended Dose     | Benefits and Evidence Level                  |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Vitamin K2 (MK-7)| 100-180 mcg/day     | Cuts fracture risk by 60-80% over 3 years (medium-sized trials with 100-500 people, GRADE B); reduces underactive bone protein by 77%. |
| Magnesium        | 320-420 mg/day      | Boosts BMD by 2-4% (studies in older adults low in magnesium, affecting 50%, GRADE B). |
| Boron            | 3-6 mg/day          | Normalizes bone protein and improves T-score by 0.5-1.5 (small trials and groups, limited evidence with varying results, GRADE C). |

Dairy for calcium is in guidelines but may cause inflammation in some (from population studies). If you absorb poorly, limit oxalates or gluten (some reports of scan improvements, but not proven widely).

## Medicines
For high-risk cases (T-score -2.5 or lower, past fracture), start bisphosphonates like alendronate (70 mg weekly) or risedronate (35 mg weekly). These cut spine and hip fractures by 44-70% over 3-4 years (strong evidence from FIT trial with 6,459 women, GRADE A). Denosumab (60 mg injection every 6 months) works similarly (44-68% reduction). Use bisphosphonates only 3-5 years to avoid rare thigh bone breaks. For very severe cases (T-score -3.0 or lower, multiple fractures), use anabolic drugs like teriparatide (20 mcg daily injection for 2 years), which raises BMD by 9-13%. Always take calcium and vitamin D with medicines. Drug company studies favor pills over lifestyle changes.

## Check-Ups and Tracking
Repeat DXA scans every 1-2 years at first, then every 2-3 years if steady. Test blood vitamin D yearly and CTX marker before/after drugs (aim for 50-70% drop). Adjust based on how well you follow the plan; lifestyle changes can reverse bone loss over time (from observation studies).

## Key Limitations
Calcium pill benefits are unclear due to possible heart risks and need for other nutrients. Boron and avoiding oxalates show promise but from small studies with bias risks. Drug and dairy company trials focus on their products and may overlook nutrition and exercise data.

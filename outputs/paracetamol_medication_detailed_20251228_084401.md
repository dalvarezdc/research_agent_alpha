## 📋 Overview

### 🧬 Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic

### 🔬 Mechanism of Action
Paracetamol primarily exerts its effects centrally by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-3) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis in the brain and spinal cord, which accounts for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory activity due to negligible inhibition of COX-2 at therapeutic doses. Additional mechanisms may involve activation of descending inhibitory serotonergic pathways and modulation of the endocannabinoid system.

## ⚗️ Pharmacology

### Absorption
Paracetamol is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed from the small intestine following oral administration, with bioavailability of 70-90% attributable to first-pass hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma concentrations occur within 0.5-2 hours post-dose. Food may delay absorption by 0.5-1 hour but does not significantly alter overall exposure.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Hepatic metabolism predominates via three main pathways: glucuronidation (50-60%), sulfation (25-35%), and minor CYP2E1-mediated oxidation (5-10%) to the reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is rapidly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione under normal conditions. In overdose or glutathione depletion, NAPQI accumulation causes centrilobular hepatotoxicity.

### Elimination
Primarily renal excretion of inactive metabolites (glucuronide and sulfate conjugates account for >90% of dose). Less than 5% is eliminated unchanged in urine. Total body clearance is approximately 300-500 mL/min in adults, with half-life influencing dosing intervals.

**Half-Life:** 1.5-3 hours in healthy adults; extended to 5-8 hours in hepatic impairment, up to 10 hours in neonates, and 3-4 hours in renal impairment.

## 💉 Clinical Use

### Approved Indications
1. Mild to moderate acute pain
2. Fever of any etiology
3. Postoperative pain management
4. Headache and migraine
5. Musculoskeletal pain

### Off-Label Uses
1. Osteoarthritis pain (chronic low-dose)
2. Chronic neuropathic pain adjunct
3. Cancer-related pain
4. Patent ductus arteriosus closure in neonates (IV)

### Standard Dosing
Adults and adolescents >12 years: 500-1000 mg orally, IV, or rectally every 4-6 hours as needed; maximum 4000 mg/day. Children 1 month-12 years: 10-15 mg/kg/dose every 4-6 hours; maximum 75 mg/kg/day (not exceeding adult max). Neonates: 10-15 mg/kg every 6-8 hours.

### Dose Adjustments
**Hepatic Impairment:**
Mild-moderate: max 2-3 g/day; severe: avoid or 500 mg every 8 hours with monitoring.

**Renal Impairment:**
CrCl <30 mL/min: extend interval to 6-8 hours; hemodialysis: supplemental dose post-dialysis.

**Elderly:**
Initiate at 500 mg every 6 hours; max 3 g/day due to reduced clearance.

**Obesity:**
Use actual body weight for dosing; avoid exceeding 4 g/day.

**Chronic Alcohol Use:**
Max 2 g/day; monitor LFTs.

## 🔗 Interactions

### 💊 Drug-Drug Interactions

#### 🟡 Warfarin (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Paracetamol may inhibit CYP2C9 or displace warfarin from albumin.

**Clinical Effect:** Elevated INR and bleeding risk with doses >2 g/day.

**Management:** Monitor INR frequently; limit paracetamol to <2 g/day.

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🔴 Chronic alcohol (SEVERE)

**Mechanism:** Induction of CYP2E1 increases NAPQI production; glutathione depletion.

**Clinical Effect:** Enhanced hepatotoxicity risk.

**Management:** Avoid chronic alcohol; limit dose to 2 g/day.

**Evidence Level:** strong


#### 🟡 Probenecid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Inhibits glucuronidation and renal excretion.

**Clinical Effect:** Prolonged half-life and increased toxicity risk.

**Management:** Monitor levels; reduce paracetamol dose.

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Lamotrigine (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Paracetamol reduces lamotrigine AUC by 20-25%.

**Clinical Effect:** Decreased lamotrigine efficacy.

**Management:** Monitor seizure control; adjust lamotrigine dose.

**Evidence Level:** limited

### 🍎 Food & Lifestyle Interactions

#### Alcohol (acute/chronic)

**Mechanism:** Acute: delayed absorption; chronic: CYP2E1 induction.

**Clinical Effect:** Increased hepatotoxicity.

**Management:** Separate by 4-6 hours if possible; counsel abstinence.

#### High-fat meal

**Mechanism:** Delayed gastric emptying.

**Clinical Effect:** Tmax delayed by 0.5-1 hour; no change in AUC.

**Management:** No adjustment needed.

### Environmental Considerations

- Store at controlled room temperature (15-30°C); protect from light and moisture.
- Do not freeze; discard if solution discolors.
- Avoid exposure to excessive heat (>40°C) which may degrade formulation.

## ⚠️ Safety Profile

### 🚨 BLACK BOX WARNINGS

1. Severe liver injury may occur with overdose (>4 g/day) or concomitant use with other paracetamol-containing products.

2. Risk of acute liver failure, transplantation, or death; early signs may be absent.

3. Do not exceed recommended dose; chronic use >3 g/day increases hepatotoxicity risk.

### Adverse Effects

**Common (>10%):**
- Nausea (3-5%)
- Vomiting (1-3%)
- Rash (1-2%)
- Pruritus
- Headache

**Serious (Any Frequency):**
- Acute hepatotoxicity (overdose >10 g)
- Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare)
- Aplastic anemia (very rare)
- Metabolic acidosis in overdose

### Contraindications

**Known hypersensitivity to paracetamol** (N/A)
- Reason: N/A

**Severe active hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)** (N/A)
- Reason: N/A

**G6PD deficiency** (N/A)
- Reason: N/A

### Warning Signs

**Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain within 24 hours of overdose** (N/A)
- Action: Immediate medical evaluation; N-acetylcysteine antidote if >150 mg/kg.

**Jaundice, confusion, coagulopathy (24-72 hours post-overdose)** (N/A)
- Action: Hospitalize; assess for hepatic failure.

**Rash, mucosal involvement** (N/A)
- Action: Discontinue; evaluate for SJS/TEN.

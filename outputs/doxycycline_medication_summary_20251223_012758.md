## 🧬 Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex at the acceptor (A) site. This inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide cha...

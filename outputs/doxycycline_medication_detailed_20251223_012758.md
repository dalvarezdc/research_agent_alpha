## 📋 Overview

### 🧬 Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Pharmacologic class: Tetracycline antibiotic. Therapeutic class: Antibacterial agent, antimalarial agent, anti-inflammatory agent (in subantimicrobial doses).

### 🔬 Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex at the acceptor (A) site. This inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain. The drug enters bacterial cells via passive diffusion and active transport. At subantimicrobial doses, doxycycline inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), reduces inflammatory cytokines, and decreases reactive oxygen species production, providing anti-inflammatory effects independent of antimicrobial activity.

## ⚗️ Pharmacology

### Absorption
Oral bioavailability: 90-100% (nearly complete absorption). Absorption is minimally affected by food or milk (unlike other tetracyclines). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur at 2-3 hours post-administration. Cmax values: approximately 1.5-3 mcg/mL after 100 mg dose. Onset of action: 1-2 hours.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Minimal hepatic metabolism. Does not undergo significant CYP450-mediated metabolism. Not converted to active metabolites. Approximately 30-40% may undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Unlike other tetracyclines, doxycycline is not significantly metabolized and is excreted largely unchanged.

### Elimination
Primary route: Fecal elimination (20-40% as active drug via bile and direct intestinal secretion) and renal excretion (23-40% as unchanged drug in urine). Biliary excretion is significant. Does not accumulate significantly in renal impairment due to compensatory fecal elimination. Clearance: 1.5-2.5 L/hour.

**Half-Life:** 15-25 hours (average 18-22 hours in adults with normal renal and hepatic function). Half-life may be prolonged to 20-30 hours in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

### Standard Dosing
Adults: Initial dose: 200 mg on day 1 (given as 100 mg every 12 hours or 200 mg once daily), followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg once daily or 100 mg every 12 hours for severe infections. Acne: 50-100 mg once or twice daily. Malaria prophylaxis: 100 mg once daily starting 1-2 days before travel, continuing during travel, and for 4 weeks after leaving endemic area. Anthrax post-exposure: 100 mg twice daily for 60 days. Periodontitis (subantimicrobial): 20 mg twice daily. Lyme disease: 100 mg twice daily for 10-21 days. Administer with adequate fluid to reduce esophageal irritation. May be taken with food or milk.

### Dose Adjustments
**Renal Impairment:**
No dose adjustment required for any degree of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease and dialysis patients. Doxycycline is not significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. This is a major advantage over other tetracyclines.

**Hepatic Impairment:**
Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment. Consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval in severe hepatic dysfunction, though specific recommendations are not well established. Monitor for increased adverse effects. Half-life may be prolonged.

**Elderly:**
No specific dose adjustment required based on age alone. However, consider age-related decline in hepatic function and increased risk of adverse effects.

**Pediatric:**
Children ≥8 years: 2-4 mg/kg/day divided every 12-24 hours (maximum 200 mg/day). Children <8 years: Generally avoided due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia. May be used for life-threatening infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever) when benefits outweigh risks, as short courses (<21 days) have minimal dental effects.

**Pregnancy:**
Pregnancy Category D. Contraindicated in pregnancy due to risk of maternal hepatotoxicity, fetal skeletal development abnormalities, and permanent tooth discoloration in the fetus. Use only if no alternatives exist and benefits clearly outweigh risks.

**Obesity:**
Limited data available. Some experts suggest considering higher doses (e.g., 100 mg twice daily) for serious infections in obese patients, though standard dosing is typically used.

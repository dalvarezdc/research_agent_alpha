  "medication_name": "Paracetamol",
  "drug_class": "Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic",
  "mechanism_of_action": "Paracetamol selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-2) more than COX-1 in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby mediating analgesic and antipyretic effects. It exhibits weak peripheral anti-inflammatory activity compared to NSAIDs. The exact central mechanism may involve additional pathways such as serotoninergic and cannabinoid systems.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Paracetamol is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed from the small intestine after oral administration, with bioavailability of 70-90%. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within 0.5-2 hours post-dose. Food, particularly high-fat meals, may delay absorption by 0.5-1 hour without significantly altering extent.",
    "metabolism": "Primarily hepatic metabolism occurs via phase II conjugation: 50-60% to paracetamol-glucuronide, 25-35% to paracetamol-sulfate, and 5-10% via CYP2E1 (minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) to the reactive intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione under normal conditions. In overdose, glutathione depletion leads to NAPQI accumulation and hepatotoxicity.",
    "elimination": "Elimination is predominantly renal, with 90-100% of dose excreted as metabolites in urine within 24 hours; less than 5% is excreted unchanged. Total body clearance is 350-500 mL/min in adults. Half-life prolongation occurs in renal impairment due to metabolite accumulation.",
    "half_life": "1.5-3 hours in healthy adults; 3-8 hours in hepatic impairment; up to 10-15 hours in neonates or severe overdose."

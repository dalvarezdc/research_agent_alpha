### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-12 12:23:46
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: - **Synthetic standardization vs. natural diversity**: Agencies push regulated probiotics despite COI (e.g., Danone-funded trials); critics favor evolutionary-aligned ferments/prebiotics for superior ...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-12 12:24:52
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: Evolutionarily, the human gut microbiome is a dynamic, high-diversity ecosystem (10^13-10^14 microbes across 500+ species) shaped by millions of years of co-evolution with diet and environment, optimi...
- Industry Bias: Distortions:
- **Regulatory Capture**: FDA/EMA classify probiotics as "GRAS" without colonization proof, enabling $50B market. Agencies echo this (e.g., NIH promotes yogurt), ignoring COI (Danone fund...
- Grey Zone: No large RCTs compare ferments/prebiotics head-to-head with probiotics for diversity, but evolutionary logic + small/independent data support **low-risk trials**:
- **Fermented Foods (e.g., kefir, sau...

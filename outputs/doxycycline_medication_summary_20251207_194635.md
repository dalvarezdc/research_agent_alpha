## Medication Overview
**Name:** doxycycline
**Drug Class:** Tetracycline antibiotic; Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent
**Analysis Confidence:** 0.75/1.00

---

## Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex at the acceptor (A) site. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thereby inhibiting b...

## 📋 Medication Overview
**Name:** Paracetamol
**Drug Class:** Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic
**Analysis Confidence:** 0.95/1.00

---

## 🧬 Mechanism of Action
Paracetamol selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-2 and COX-3) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis responsible for pain and fever. It exhibits minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory activity compared to NSAIDs. Additional mechanisms include activation of descendi...

## ⚗️ Pharmacokinetics Summary
- **Absorption:** Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine with bioavailability of 70-90% due to first...
- **Metabolism:** Hepatic metabolism predominates: 50-60% glucuronidation, 25-35% sulfation, 5-10% CYP2E1-mediated oxi...
- **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites (glucuronide 55%, sulfate 30%, cysteine/mercapturic acid 10...
- **Half-Life:** 1-4 hours (mean 2-3 hours) in healthy adults; prolonged to 5-8 hours in hepatic impairment, neonates, or malnutrition. Therapeutic range monitoring uses Rumack-Matthew nomogram in overdose.

## ⚠️ Key Safety Information

### ⚠️ BLACK BOX WARNINGS

1. Severe liver injury may occur with therapeutic doses exceeding 4000 mg/day or lower in risk factors (alcohol, malnutrition); check total daily dose from all sources.
2. Overdosage (>7.5-10 g acute) risks fulminant hepatic failure requiring transplant; antidotal therapy with N-acetylcysteine within 8-24 hours critical.
3. Risk increased 3-4 fold with chronic alcohol use (>3 drinks/day).

## Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-05 03:15:08
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: ### Diagnostic Framework
- **Definition**: Chronic fungal infections are persistent or recurrent infections lasting >4 weeks, primarily candidiasis, dermatophytosis, or onychomycosis
- **Prevalence**:...
- Counter Narrative: ### Expanded Disease Model
**"Fungal Dysbiosis Syndrome"**
- Chronic low-grade fungal overgrowth as a spectrum condition affecting immunocompetent individuals
- Biofilm formation allows persistence de...
- Key Conflicts: - Pharmaceutical industry: No profit motive to study dietary interventions
- Food industry: Active interest in defending high-carb products
- Academic medicine: Institutional inertia, reductionist dru...

### Phase 2: Evidence Stress Test

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-05 03:16:47
**User Choice:** Proceed

**Key Findings:**
- Industry Funded Studies: **Fluconazole Efficacy Studies (1990s-2010s):**
- **Pattern observed**: Short follow-up periods (2-4 weeks)
- **Missing data**: Long-term recurrence rates underreported
- **Example**: Sobel et al. (20...
- Independent Research: **RED FLAGS IN OFFICIAL NARRATIVE:**
1. Dismissal of "chronic candida" appears premature given emerging biofilm/microbiome science
2. No dietary guidance despite strong mechanistic rationale
3. Pharma...
- Methodology Quality: - **Finding**: 100% of Candida strains inhibited at concentrations achievable with dietary intake
- **Follow-up**: Minimal - no pharmaceutical interest in non-patentable compound
**PRIORITY SIGNAL:**
...
- Anecdotal Signals: - **Funding**: NIH, VA Merit Review (government only)
- **Design**:
  - Developed catheter biofilm model
  - Tested antifungal penetration with confocal microscopy
  - Quantified persister cell popula...
- Time Weighted Evidence: - **Study**: "Nutritional immunity and fungal pathogenesis"
- **Funding**: German Research Foundation (DFG)
- **Finding**: Iron restriction (via lactoferrin) inhibits Candida hyphal formation
- **Mech...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-05 03:18:22
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: ### The Glucose-Fungus Connection is Real and Causal
**Evolutionary Logic**: Candida species evolved as glucose-opportunistic organisms over millions of years. The modern Western diet (40-60% refined ...
- Industry Bias: **VERDICT**: **Biofilm disruption is non-negotiable for chronic infections**. NAC (600-1200mg 2x/daily) + proteolytic enzymes are cheap, safe, and mechanistically sound.

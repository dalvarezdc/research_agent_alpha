## Overview

### Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Tetracycline antibiotic; Bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical bacteria, and certain parasites

### Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor (A) site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Additionally, doxycycline may alter cytoplasmic membrane permeability and has anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), phospholipase A2, and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNF-α. At subantimicrobial doses, it demonstrates anti-collagenase activity.

## Pharmacology

### Absorption
Oral bioavailability: 90-100% (nearly complete absorption). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved in 1.5-4 hours after oral administration. Food and dairy products have minimal effect on absorption compared to other tetracyclines, though high-fat meals may slightly delay absorption. Absorption occurs primarily in the stomach and upper small intestine.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Minimal hepatic metabolism. Does not undergo significant CYP450-mediated metabolism. Small amounts may be metabolized to inactive metabolites. Unlike other tetracyclines, doxycycline is not significantly affected by hepatic impairment due to minimal hepatic metabolism and alternative elimination pathways.

### Elimination
Primary routes: Fecal elimination (20-40% as active drug via biliary excretion and direct intestinal secretion) and renal excretion (23-40% as unchanged drug). Enterohepatic recirculation occurs. Renal clearance: 40-50 mL/min. Does not accumulate significantly in renal impairment due to compensatory fecal elimination. Elimination half-life: 15-25 hours (mean 18-22 hours) in adults with normal renal function.

**Half-Life:** 15-25 hours (mean 18-22 hours); may be prolonged to 20-30 hours in patients with severe renal impairment, though clinically insignificant

### Standard Dosing
Adults: Initial loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 (given as 100 mg every 12 hours or 200 mg once daily), followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg once daily or 100 mg every 12 hours for more severe infections. For acute infections: 100 mg every 12 hours. For acne: 50-100 mg once or twice daily. For malaria prophylaxis: 100 mg once daily starting 1-2 days before travel, continuing during travel, and for 4 weeks after leaving endemic area. For anthrax post-exposure: 100 mg twice daily for 60 days. Pediatric (>8 years, weight-based): Day 1: 4.4 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours (max 200 mg/day); maintenance: 2.2 mg/kg/day once daily or divided every 12 hours (max 100 mg/dose). Take with adequate fluid to reduce esophageal irritation.

### Dose Adjustments
**Renal Impairment:**
No dose adjustment required for any degree of renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or dialysis. Doxycycline is not significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Standard dosing can be used safely in patients with CrCl <10 mL/min.

**Hepatic Impairment:**
No specific dose adjustment recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment due to minimal hepatic metabolism. Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment; monitor for adverse effects. Consider alternative therapy if severe hepatic dysfunction present, though doxycycline is generally safer than other tetracyclines in this population.

**Elderly:**
No routine dose adjustment required. Use standard adult dosing. Monitor for adverse effects and ensure adequate hydration.

**Pregnancy:**
Pregnancy Category D. Contraindicated in pregnancy, especially after first trimester, due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration, enamel hypoplasia, and inhibition of bone growth in fetus. Use only if potential benefit justifies potential risk and no alternatives available.

**Pediatric Considerations:**
Generally avoided in children <8 years due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia. However, may be used for serious infections (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anthrax) when benefits outweigh risks. Short courses (≤21 days) appear to have minimal risk of dental staining.

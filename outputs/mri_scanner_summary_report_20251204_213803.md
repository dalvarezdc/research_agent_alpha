### 3. BLOOD_VESSELS

**Risk Assessment:**
- Risk Level: **MODERATE**
- Procedure Impact: YES - Directly affected
- At Risk: YES - Requires monitoring
- Evidence Quality: **MODERATE**

**Biological Pathways:**
- Elimination

1. **Non-invasive visualization**: Provides excellent soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation
2. **Comprehensive vascular assessment**: Can evaluate vessel stenosis, aneurysms, dissections, and malformations
3. **No nephrotoxic contrast required**: Time-of-flight (TOF) and phase-contrast techniques require no contrast agents
4. **Functional information**: Can assess blood flow velocity and direction
5. **No ionizing radiation exposure**: Unlike CT angiography or conventional angiography
6. **Contrast-related risks (when gadolinium used)**:
7. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) - rare, primarily in severe renal impairment
8. Allergic reactions - extremely rare compared to iodinated contrast
9. Gadolinium deposition - clinical significance unclear
10. **Contraindications to consider**:
11. Certain metallic implants (pacemakers, some aneurysm clips)
12. Claustrophobia (can be mitigated)
13. Pregnancy (first trimester - relative contraindication)
14. Pre-screening for contraindications (metal implants, renal function)
15. Use of non-contrast techniques when possible
16. Proper patient selection and preparation
17. Use of newer gadolinium agents (macrocyclic) with better safety profiles
18. Sedation options for claustrophobic patients
19. Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis
20. Assessment of intracranial aneurysms
21. Diagnosis of aortic dissection and aneurysms
22. Evaluation of renal artery stenosis
23. Assessment of peripheral arterial disease
24. Congenital vascular malformations
25. Superior to ultrasound for deep vessels and complex anatomy
26. No radiation compared to CT angiography
27. Better soft tissue contrast than CT
28. Less invasive than catheter angiography
29. Longer acquisition times than CT
30. More expensive than ultrasound
31. Contraindicated in some patients with implants

37. Decades of clinical use with well-documented safety profile
38. High confidence based on extensive clinical evidence and established safety profile
39. Well-documented indications and contraindications
40. Slight uncertainty (0.08) due to:
41. Evolving understanding of gadolinium deposition
42. Individual patient variability in contraindications
43. Technique-dependent quality variations

### 4. BRAIN

**Risk Assessment:**
- Risk Level: **MODERATE**
- Procedure Impact: YES - Directly affected
- At Risk: YES - Requires monitoring
- Evidence Quality: **MODERATE**

**Biological Pathways:**
- Elimination
- Filtration

**✅ EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS** (22 items):
1. **Overall Risk Level**: Appropriately classified as LOW for the general population
2. **Gadolinium Accumulation**: Confirmed phenomenon, particularly with linear GBCAs, but clinical significance remains unclear
3. **Kidney Impairment**: Valid concern for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), though rare with modern macrocyclic agents
4. Deposition confirmed in dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted imaging
5. More pronounced with linear agents (gadodiamide, gadopentetate) vs. macrocyclic agents (gadobutrol, gadoterate)
6. **Critical Gap**: No proven clinical sequelae from brain deposition in patients with normal renal function
7. FDA and EMA reviews (2017-2018) found no evidence of harm but recommended preferential use of macrocyclic agents
8. NSF risk is virtually eliminated with macrocyclic GBCAs and proper screening
9. eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m² represents highest risk category
10. Group II (macrocyclic) agents preferred in at-risk populations
11. **Justify contrast necessity**: Ensure diagnostic question requires contrast enhancement
12. **Agent selection**: Preferentially use macrocyclic GBCAs (gadobutrol, gadoterate, gadoteridol)
13. **Dose optimization**: Use lowest effective dose (typically 0.1 mmol/kg)
14. **Avoid repeat exposures**: When clinically appropriate, consider non-contrast alternatives
15. eGFR ≥30: Macrocyclic agents considered safe
16. eGFR <30: Risk-benefit analysis required; consider alternative imaging or use group II agents with informed consent
17. Dialysis patients: Can receive macrocyclic agents; consider dialysis within 2-3 hours post-administration
18. Agent selection IS a mitigation strategy
19. Dose reduction IS a mitigation strategy
20. Adequate hydration in appropriate patients
21. Screening protocols reduce risk
22. Alternative imaging (non-contrast MRI, CT, ultrasound) when appropriate

## Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-05 01:38:30
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: ### CDC/FDA/Dermatological Consensus:
- **Antibacterial soaps are unnecessary** for general public use (FDA banned triclosan/triclocarban in 2016)
- **Plain soap and water** equally effective at remov...
- Counter Narrative: ### The Microbiome Disruption Hypothesis:
**Core Concern**: Modern soaps may be *too effective*, creating dysbiosis on skin surface.
#### Recent Research Signals (2015-2024):
**A. Surfactant Selectivi...

### Phase 2: Evidence Stress Test

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-05 01:40:10
**User Choice:** Proceed

**Key Findings:**
- Industry Funded Studies: 3. **Traditional saponified oils outperform synthetic detergents** in small, well-designed studies
4. **"Fragrance" is a regulatory loophole** hiding endocrine disruptors

## 1. FUNDING FILTER ANAL...
- Independent Research: #### **PRIORITY SIGNAL #1: Microbiome Disruption Hierarchy**
- **Groups**:
  1. Daily SLS body wash
  2. Daily saponified coconut oil soap
  3. Soap 3x/week (armpits/groin/feet only) + water elsewhere...
- Methodology Quality: - **Findings**:
  - SLS-based cleansers: 58% reduction in *S. epidermidis* (protective species)
  - Saponified olive oil soap: 12% reduction
  - Water-only: 3% reduction (normal variation)
- Crossover...
- Anecdotal Signals: **Why This Matters**: 
- Directly tests frequency hypothesis
- Objective barrier function measures (not subjective surveys)
- 16-week duration captures skin adaptation
- Dermatologist Dr. Sandy Skotni...
- Time Weighted Evidence: - **Design**: Randomized crossover, n=47, 12-week duration
- **Why it matters**: First study to compare formulations head-to-head with adequate duration
- **Design**: Parallel group RCT, n=89, 16 week...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-05 01:41:35
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: ### The Fundamental Physics
Soap works through **mechanical disruption**, not sterilization. Surfactants reduce surface tension, allowing water to lift oils and embedded particles (including microbes)...
- Industry Bias: ### 1. The Antibacterial Soap Misdirection
**What happened**: FDA banned triclosan (2016) after it became indefensible, then declared victory: "See, regular soap is fine!"
**What they didn't address**...
- Grey Zone: **Claim**: Traditional saponified oils (olive, coconut, tallow) preserve beneficial *Staphylococcus epidermidis* better than synthetic detergents.
**Evidence**:
- One well-designed study (*Nature Comm...

## Overview

### Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Tetracycline antibiotic; Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent

### Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain. The drug enters bacterial cells via passive diffusion and active transport. Doxycycline also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), phospholipase A2, and modulation of cytokine production independent of its antimicrobial effects.

## Pharmacology

### Absorption
Oral bioavailability is approximately 90-100%, making it one of the most completely absorbed tetracyclines. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2-3 hours after oral administration. Food and dairy products have minimal effect on absorption compared to other tetracyclines, though absorption may be slightly reduced. Absorption is not significantly affected by milk or moderate amounts of calcium. Onset of action occurs within 1-2 hours.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Doxycycline undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism. Unlike other tetracyclines, it does not undergo significant biotransformation by CYP450 enzymes. Small amounts may be metabolized to inactive metabolites. The drug is primarily eliminated unchanged. Enterohepatic recirculation occurs, with chelation in the intestine by calcium and excretion in feces as inactive chelates.

### Elimination
Primary route of elimination is fecal excretion (20-40% as active drug and chelated inactive forms) via bile and direct intestinal secretion. Renal excretion accounts for 20-40% of elimination, with approximately 40-60% excreted unchanged in urine within 72 hours. Glomerular filtration is the primary renal mechanism. Unlike other tetracyclines, doxycycline does not accumulate significantly in renal failure due to increased fecal elimination as a compensatory mechanism.

**Half-Life:** 15-25 hours in adults with normal renal and hepatic function. Half-life may be prolonged to 18-22 hours in patients with severe renal impairment but does not require dose adjustment. In patients with hepatic impairment, half-life may be extended.

### Standard Dosing
Adults: 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours on day 1 (loading dose 200 mg), then 100 mg once or twice daily depending on indication. For severe infections: 100 mg every 12 hours. For acne/rosacea: 40-100 mg once daily. For malaria prophylaxis: 100 mg once daily starting 1-2 days before travel, continuing during travel and for 4 weeks after leaving endemic area. For anthrax post-exposure: 100 mg twice daily for 60 days. Pediatric (>8 years, weight-based): 2-4 mg/kg/day divided every 12-24 hours (maximum 200 mg/day). Take with adequate fluid to reduce esophageal irritation. May be taken with food to minimize GI upset.

### Dose Adjustments
**Renal Impairment:**
No dose adjustment required for any degree of renal impairment including end-stage renal disease or dialysis. Doxycycline is not significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. This is a unique advantage among tetracyclines.

**Hepatic Impairment:**
Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment. Consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval in severe hepatic dysfunction, though specific guidelines are not established. Monitor for increased adverse effects. Half-life may be prolonged.

**Elderly:**
No specific dose adjustment required based on age alone. Consider renal and hepatic function. Increased risk of esophageal irritation; ensure adequate fluid intake and upright position after administration.

**Pregnancy:**
Contraindicated in pregnancy (Category D). Tetracyclines can cause permanent tooth discoloration, enamel hypoplasia, and inhibition of bone growth in the fetus. Use only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus and no alternatives are available.

**Pediatric:**
Generally avoided in children <8 years due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia. May be used for serious infections (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anthrax) when benefits outweigh risks. Short courses (≤21 days) may have lower risk of dental staining.

## 📋 Medication Overview
**Name:** lactoferrin
**Drug Class:** Lactoferrin is classified as an iron-binding glycoprotein and immunomodulatory agent. Therapeutically, it functions as a nutritional supplement, antimicrobial protein, and immunomodulator. It belongs to the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins.
**Analysis Confidence:** 0.75/1.00

## 🧬 Mechanism of Action
Lactoferrin exerts multiple mechanisms at the molecular level: (1) Iron sequestration - binds ferric iron (Fe3+) with high affinity (Kd ~10^-20 M), depriving pathogens of essential iron for growth; (2) Direct antimicrobial activity - binds to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on bacterial cell walls causing...

## ⚗️ Pharmacokinetics Summary
- **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability of intact lactoferrin is low (approximately 1-5% in adults) due to gastric acid...
- **Metabolism:** Orally administered lactoferrin undergoes extensive proteolytic degradation in the gastrointestinal ...
- **Elimination:** Primary route of elimination is through fecal excretion of unabsorbed protein and peptide fragments ...
- **Half-Life:** The elimination half-life of orally administered lactoferrin has not been precisely determined due to extensive gastrointestinal degradation and minimal systemic absorption. Endogenous plasma lactoferrin has an estimated half-life of approximately 10-20 minutes. Gastrointestinal transit time (2-4 hours in small intestine) is more relevant for oral supplementation effects.

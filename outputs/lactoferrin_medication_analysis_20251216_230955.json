  "medication_name": "lactoferrin",
  "drug_class": "Lactoferrin is classified as an iron-binding glycoprotein and immunomodulatory agent. Therapeutically, it functions as a nutritional supplement, antimicrobial protein, and immunomodulator. It belongs to the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins.",
  "mechanism_of_action": "Lactoferrin exerts multiple mechanisms at the molecular level: (1) Iron sequestration - binds ferric iron (Fe3+) with high affinity (Kd ~10^-20 M), depriving pathogens of essential iron for growth; (2) Direct antimicrobial activity - binds to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on bacterial membranes causing membrane disruption and increased permeability; (3) Immunomodulation - binds to cellular receptors including LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) and intelectin-1, modulating cytokine production (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10); (4) Antiviral activity - binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and viral particles, preventing cellular attachment and entry; (5) Promotes beneficial gut microbiota by selective antimicrobial effects; (6) Modulates iron homeostasis through interaction with ferroportin and DMT1 transporters; (7) Anti-inflammatory effects via NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and reduction of reactive oxygen species.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Oral bioavailability of intact lactoferrin is low (approximately 1-5% in adults) due to gastric acid degradation and proteolytic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. In neonates and infants, bioavailability is higher (up to 60%) due to lower gastric acidity and presence of specific lactoferrin receptors in the intestinal epithelium. Peak plasma concentrations are typically reached 2-4 hours post-administration. Absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine via receptor-mediated endocytosis through intelectin-1 and other lactoferrin-specific receptors. Enteric-coated formulations improve stability and absorption.",
    "metabolism": "Lactoferrin undergoes proteolytic degradation by pepsin in the stomach and pancreatic proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin) in the small intestine, generating bioactive peptides including lactoferricin and other fragments. These peptides retain antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. Metabolism does not involve cytochrome P450 enzymes. Intestinal brush border peptidases further degrade lactoferrin into smaller peptides and amino acids. Some intact lactoferrin and larger peptide fragments may be absorbed and subsequently metabolized by tissue proteases. The iron released from lactoferrin enters normal iron metabolic pathways.",
    "elimination": "Primary route of elimination is through gastrointestinal degradation and fecal excretion of unabsorbed protein and peptide fragments. Systemically absorbed lactoferrin and peptides are eliminated via renal filtration and hepatic uptake. Renal clearance of intact lactoferrin is minimal due to molecular size (80 kDa), but smaller peptide fragments may undergo glomerular filtration. Hepatic uptake occurs via asialoglycoprotein receptors. Biliary excretion contributes to enterohepatic circulation of lactoferrin-derived peptides.",
    "half_life": "The elimination half-life of orally administered lactoferrin is approximately 2-4 hours for detectable peptide fragments in plasma. For intact lactoferrin following intravenous administration in animal studies, the half-life ranges from 5-15 minutes due to rapid hepatic uptake and tissue distribution. Biological activity in the gastrointestinal tract persists for 6-12 hours post-administration due to gradual proteolytic degradation and local effects."

For inflammatory conditions: 100-200 mg orally three times daily (up to 600 mg total daily dose). Topical formulations for dermatologic or ophthalmic use: concentration ranges from 0.1-5% applied 1-3 times daily. Duration of supplementation typically ranges from 4-12 weeks depending on indication. Should be taken on an empty stomach or with meals depending on formulation and gastrointestinal tolerance.",
    "dose_adjustments": {
      "renal_impairment": "No specific dose adjustment required for oral lactoferrin supplementation in renal impairment, as systemic absorption is minimal. However, monitoring is advised in severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) due to theoretical accumulation of peptide fragments. Consider reducing dose by 25-50% in end-stage renal disease.",
      "hepatic_impairment": "No specific dose adjustment required for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A-B). Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) as hepatic uptake and metabolism may be altered. No formal studies available; clinical judgment should guide dosing.",
      "pediatric": "Infants and children: 10-20 mg/kg/day divided into 2-3 doses for supplementation. Preterm infants for NEC prevention: 100-200 mg three times daily. Safety established in pediatric populations; adjust dose based on age and weight.",

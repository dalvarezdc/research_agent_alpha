## Overview

### Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Pharmacologic class: Aminopenicillin, beta-lactam antibiotic. Therapeutic class: Antibacterial agent with activity against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.

### Mechanism of Action
Amoxicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically PBP1a, PBP1b, PBP2, and PBP3. This binding prevents the transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. The drug interferes with the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains, which are essential for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. This leads to cell wall weakening, osmotic instability, cell lysis, and bacterial death. Amoxicillin is bactericidal and most effective against actively dividing bacteria. It is susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes produced by resistant bacteria.

## Pharmacology

### Absorption
Oral bioavailability: approximately 74-92% (well absorbed from GI tract). Absorption is not significantly affected by food. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur at 1-2 hours after oral administration. For a 500 mg dose, Cmax is approximately 7-8 mcg/mL. Onset of action occurs within 1-2 hours. Absorption is more complete than ampicillin due to better acid stability.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Minimal hepatic metabolism. Approximately 10-25% of amoxicillin is metabolized in the liver to inactive penicilloic acid metabolites. Does not undergo significant CYP450-mediated metabolism. Most of the drug is excreted unchanged.

### Elimination
Primary route: Renal excretion. Approximately 60-80% excreted unchanged in urine within 6-8 hours via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Small amounts eliminated in feces (10-25%). Probenecid decreases renal tubular secretion and increases serum concentrations. Removed by hemodialysis (approximately 50% in 3-4 hours).

**Half-Life:** 1-1.5 hours in patients with normal renal function. Increases to 7-20 hours in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <10 mL/min). Neonates: 3-4 hours. Infants and children: 1-2 hours.

5. Prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
6. Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy
7. Typhoid fever (alternative agent)
8. Periodontitis and dental infections

### Standard Dosing
Adults: 250-500 mg every 8 hours OR 500-875 mg every 12 hours depending on severity of infection. Maximum: 1750-3000 mg/day in divided doses. For severe infections or difficult-to-treat organisms: 875 mg every 12 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours. Pediatric dosing: 20-50 mg/kg/day divided every 8-12 hours (maximum 500 mg/dose for mild-moderate infections, 875 mg/dose for severe infections). For H. pylori: 1000 mg twice daily in triple or quadruple therapy regimens. Endocarditis prophylaxis: 2 g single dose 30-60 minutes before procedure.

### Dose Adjustments
**Renal Impairment Mild:**
CrCl 30-50 mL/min: No adjustment necessary for most infections

**Renal Impairment Moderate:**
CrCl 10-30 mL/min: 250-500 mg every 12 hours

**Renal Impairment Severe:**
CrCl <10 mL/min: 250-500 mg every 24 hours

**Hemodialysis:**
250-500 mg every 24 hours with an additional dose during and after dialysis

**Peritoneal Dialysis:**
250 mg every 12 hours

**Hepatic Impairment:**
No dosage adjustment necessary; hepatic metabolism is minimal

**Elderly:**
Adjust dose based on renal function; elderly patients often have decreased renal function

**Pregnancy:**
Category B - generally considered safe; no dose adjustment needed

**Obesity:**
Consider higher doses for severe infections; some sources recommend dosing based on actual body weight

## Interactions

### Drug-Drug Interactions

#### 🔴 Methotrexate (SEVERE)

**Mechanism:** Amoxicillin reduces renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, decreasing its elimination

**Clinical Effect:** Increased methotrexate toxicity including myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and mucositis

**Management:** Avoid concurrent use when possible. If necessary, monitor methotrexate levels closely, increase hydration, and consider leucovorin rescue. Monitor CBC, renal and hepatic function

**Evidence Level:** high


#### 🟡 Warfarin (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Amoxicillin may alter gut flora that produce vitamin K, and may displace warfarin from protein binding sites

**Clinical Effect:** Enhanced anticoagulant effect with increased risk of bleeding and elevated INR

**Management:** Monitor INR more frequently (every 3-7 days) during and after antibiotic therapy. Adjust warfarin dose as needed

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Oral Contraceptives (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Disruption of enterohepatic circulation of estrogens by altering gut flora, potentially reducing contraceptive efficacy

**Clinical Effect:** Possible decreased contraceptive effectiveness with risk of unintended pregnancy

**Management:** Advise patients to use additional barrier contraception during antibiotic therapy and for 7 days after completion

**Evidence Level:** low


#### 🟡 Allopurinol (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Unknown mechanism, possibly immunologic hypersensitivity reaction

**Clinical Effect:** Increased incidence of skin rash (up to 22% vs 8% with amoxicillin alone)

**Management:** Monitor for rash development. Discontinue if severe rash occurs. Consider alternative antibiotic if patient has history of rash with this combination

**Evidence Level:** high


#### 🟡 Probenecid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Probenecid competitively inhibits renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin

**Clinical Effect:** Increased and prolonged amoxicillin serum concentrations, potentially increasing both efficacy and adverse effects

**Management:** May be used therapeutically to increase amoxicillin levels. Monitor for increased adverse effects. Reduce amoxicillin dose if toxicity occurs

**Evidence Level:** high


#### 🟡 Mycophenolate (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Amoxicillin may reduce gut flora responsible for converting inactive mycophenolate glucuronide back to active mycophenolate

**Clinical Effect:** Decreased mycophenolate exposure (AUC reduced by 30-50%) with potential loss of immunosuppressive efficacy and risk of transplant rejection

**Management:** Monitor mycophenolate levels if available. Watch for signs of rejection. Consider increasing mycophenolate dose during antibiotic therapy

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Typhoid Vaccine (Live) (MODERATE)

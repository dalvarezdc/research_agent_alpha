  "medication_name": "Paracetamol",
  "drug_class": "Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic",
  "mechanism_of_action": "Paracetamol selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-2 and COX-3) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis responsible for pain and fever. It exhibits minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory activity compared to NSAIDs. Additional mechanisms include activation of descending inhibitory serotonergic pathways and cannabinoid receptor modulation, supported by strong preclinical evidence and clinical trials.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine with bioavailability of 70-90% due to first-pass hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma levels occur 0.5-2 hours post-oral dose; intravenous administration achieves 100% bioavailability instantly. Food, particularly high-fat meals, may delay absorption by 0.5-1 hour without altering extent.",
    "metabolism": "Hepatic metabolism predominates: 50-60% glucuronidation, 25-35% sulfation, 5-10% CYP2E1-mediated oxidation to NAPQI (detoxified by glutathione). Minor pathways involve CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Chronic alcohol use induces CYP2E1, increasing NAPQI production.",
    "elimination": "Primarily renal excretion of metabolites (glucuronide 55%, sulfate 30%, cysteine/mercapturic acid 10%); <5% unchanged drug. Clearance is 300-500 mL/min in adults; reduced in renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). Dialyzable in overdose.",
    "half_life": "1-4 hours (mean 2-3 hours) in healthy adults; prolonged to 5-8 hours in hepatic impairment, neonates, or malnutrition. Therapeutic range monitoring uses Rumack-Matthew nomogram in overdose."

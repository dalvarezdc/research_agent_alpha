  "agent_type": "medication_analyzer",
  "medication_name": "doxycycline",
  "drug_class": "Tetracycline antibiotic; Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent",
  "mechanism_of_action": "Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex at the acceptor (A) site. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Doxycycline also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), phospholipase A2, and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It chelates metal ions (calcium, magnesium, iron) which contributes to its antimicrobial activity and some adverse effects.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Oral bioavailability: 90-100% (nearly complete absorption). Absorption is minimally affected by food or milk (unlike other tetracyclines). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur at 2-3 hours after oral administration. Cmax values range from 1.5-3.5 mcg/mL after a 100 mg dose. Absorption occurs primarily in the stomach and upper small intestine.",
    "metabolism": "Minimal hepatic metabolism. Unlike other tetracyclines, doxycycline does not undergo significant metabolism by CYP450 enzymes. Small amounts may be metabolized to inactive metabolites. Does not produce clinically significant active metabolites. Enterohepatic recirculation occurs, contributing to prolonged half-life.",
    "elimination": "Primary route: Fecal elimination (20-40% as active drug) via biliary excretion and direct intestinal secretion. Renal elimination: 20-40% excreted unchanged in urine via glomerular filtration. Total body clearance: 1.5-2.5 L/hour. Elimination is not significantly affected by renal impairment, making it the tetracycline of choice in patients with renal dysfunction.",
    "half_life": "15-25 hours (average 18-22 hours) in adults with normal renal and hepatic function. Half-life may be prolonged to 20-30 hours in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

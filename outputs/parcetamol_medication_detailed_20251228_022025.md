## 📋 Overview

### 🧬 Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic

### 🔬 Mechanism of Action
Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis responsible for pain and fever.

---

## ⚗️ Pharmacology

### Absorption
Rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; peak plasma concentrations within 0.5-2 hours.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Primarily hepatic via glucuronidation and sulfation (90%); minor CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 metabolism to reactive NAPQI metabolite, detoxified by glutathione.

### Elimination
Renal excretion of metabolites (primarily glucuronide and sulfate conjugates); less than 5% excreted unchanged.

**Half-Life:** 1-4 hours (average 2-3 hours)

---

## 💉 Clinical Use

### Approved Indications
1. Mild to moderate pain
2. Fever

### Off-Label Uses
1. Headache
2. Musculoskeletal pain
3. Postoperative pain

### Standard Dosing
Adults: 500-1000 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed; maximum 4 g/day. Children: Weight-based (10-15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours; max 75 mg/kg/day). Adjust by formulation (e.g., 500 mg tablets for adults/children >10 years).

### Dose Adjustments
**Hepatic Impairment:**
Reduce dose or avoid; maximum 2 g/day in mild-moderate

**Renal Impairment:**
Prolong dosing interval (e.g., every 8 hours if CrCl <30 mL/min)

**Elderly:**
No routine adjustment; monitor for hepatotoxicity

**Pregnancy:**
Lowest effective dose, shortest duration

## 🔗 Interactions

### 💊 Drug-Drug Interactions

#### 🟡 Other paracetamol-containing products (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Additive hepatotoxicity

**Clinical Effect:** Increased risk of overdose and liver damage

**Management:** Avoid concurrent use; check all medications for paracetamol content

**Evidence Level:** high


#### 🟡 Warfarin (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Paracetamol may inhibit warfarin metabolism

**Clinical Effect:** Elevated INR

**Management:** Monitor INR closely

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Probenecid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Inhibits glucuronidation

**Clinical Effect:** Prolonged paracetamol half-life

**Management:** Monitor for toxicity

**Evidence Level:** moderate

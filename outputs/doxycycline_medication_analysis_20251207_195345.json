  "agent_type": "medication_analyzer",
  "medication_name": "doxycycline",
  "drug_class": "Tetracycline antibiotic; Bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical bacteria, and certain parasites",
  "mechanism_of_action": "Doxycycline reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor (A) site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Additionally, doxycycline may alter cytoplasmic membrane permeability and has anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), phospholipase A2, and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. At subantimicrobial doses, it demonstrates anti-collagenase activity.",
  "pharmacokinetics": {
    "absorption": "Oral bioavailability: 90-100% (nearly complete absorption). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved in 1.5-4 hours after oral administration. Food and dairy products have minimal effect on absorption compared to other tetracyclines, though high-fat meals may slightly delay absorption. Absorption occurs primarily in the stomach and upper small intestine.",
    "metabolism": "Minimal hepatic metabolism. Does not undergo significant CYP450-mediated metabolism. Small amounts may be metabolized to inactive metabolites. Unlike other tetracyclines, doxycycline is not significantly affected by hepatic impairment due to minimal hepatic metabolism and alternative elimination pathways.",
    "elimination": "Primary routes: Fecal elimination (20-40% as active drug via biliary excretion and direct intestinal secretion) and renal excretion (23-40% as unchanged drug). Enterohepatic recirculation occurs. Renal clearance: 40-50 mL/min. Does not accumulate significantly in renal impairment due to compensatory fecal elimination. Elimination half-life: 15-25 hours (mean 18-22 hours) in adults with normal renal function.",
    "half_life": "15-25 hours (mean 18-22 hours); may be prolonged to 20-30 hours in patients with severe renal impairment, though clinically insignificant"

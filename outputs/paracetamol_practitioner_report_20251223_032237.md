## 🧬 Pharmacology

### 🎯 Mechanism of Action
Exact mechanism not fully elucidated. Primarily inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, possibly a COX-3 variant, reducing prostaglandin E2 synthesis and hypothalamic fever response. Weak peripheral COX-1/COX-2 inhibition. Additional actions include activation of descending serotonergic inhibitory pathways, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) modulation, and inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), enhancing endocannabinoid signaling.

### ⚗️ Pharmacokinetics
- **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract; oral bioavailability 70-90%; onset of analgesia 15-60 minutes; peak plasma concentration 0.5-2 hours.
- **Metabolism:** Hepatic phase II conjugation predominant: glucuronidation (50-60%), sulfation (25-35%); minor CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 oxidation to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), detoxified by glutathione.
- **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites (90-100% within 24 hours); <5% excreted unchanged in urine.
- **Half-Life:** 1.5-3 hours in adults (prolonged to 4-8 hours in hepatic impairment or neonates).

## ⚠️ Safety Profile

### 🔴 Adverse Effects



---

## 🔗 Drug-Drug Interactions

### 🔴 SEVERE Interactions (1)

#### Ethanol (chronic heavy use)
**Mechanism:** PK: Induction of CYP2E1, increasing toxic NAPQI metabolite formation

**Clinical Effect:** Hepatotoxicity, potentially fulminant liver failure

**Management:** Avoid concurrent use; if necessary, use minimal effective paracetamol dose and monitor LFTs closely

**Evidence Level:** moderate

### 🟡 Moderate Interactions (4)

**Warfarin:** Elevated INR, increased bleeding risk

**Lamotrigine:** Decreased lamotrigine plasma concentrations, reduced efficacy

**Probenecid:** Increased paracetamol exposure, risk of toxicity

**Isoniazid:** Elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity

### 🟢 Minor Interactions (3)

- Metoclopramide: Faster onset of action, no change in overall exposure
- Cholestyramine: Reduced paracetamol absorption if co-administered
- Activated charcoal: Decreased paracetamol bioavailability

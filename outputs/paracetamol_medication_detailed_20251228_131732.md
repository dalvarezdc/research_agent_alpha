## 📋 Overview

### 🧬 Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic

### 🔬 Mechanism of Action
Paracetamol selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-2 and COX-3) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis responsible for pain and fever. It exhibits minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory activity compared to NSAIDs. Additional mechanisms include activation of descending inhibitory serotonergic pathways and cannabinoid receptor modulation, supported by strong preclinical evidence and clinical trials.

## ⚗️ Pharmacology

### Absorption
Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine with bioavailability of 70-90% due to first-pass hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma levels occur 0.5-2 hours post-oral dose; intravenous administration achieves 100% bioavailability instantly. Food, particularly high-fat meals, may delay absorption by 0.5-1 hour without altering extent.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Hepatic metabolism predominates: 50-60% glucuronidation, 25-35% sulfation, 5-10% CYP2E1-mediated oxidation to NAPQI (detoxified by glutathione). Minor pathways involve CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Chronic alcohol use induces CYP2E1, increasing NAPQI production.

### Elimination
Primarily renal excretion of metabolites (glucuronide 55%, sulfate 30%, cysteine/mercapturic acid 10%); <5% unchanged drug. Clearance is 300-500 mL/min in adults; reduced in renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). Dialyzable in overdose.

**Half-Life:** 1-4 hours (mean 2-3 hours) in healthy adults; prolonged to 5-8 hours in hepatic impairment, neonates, or malnutrition. Therapeutic range monitoring uses Rumack-Matthew nomogram in overdose.

## 💉 Clinical Use

### Approved Indications
1. Mild to moderate acute pain
2. Fever of any origin
3. Postoperative pain

### Off-Label Uses
1. Chronic osteoarthritis pain (moderate evidence)
2. Migraine prophylaxis (limited evidence)
3. Patent ductus arteriosus closure in neonates (strong evidence)

### Standard Dosing
Adults: 500-1000 mg orally/IV/rectally every 4-6 hours PRN; maximum 4000 mg/24 hours. Children >12 years: same as adults; 2-12 years: 10-15 mg/kg/dose every 4-6 hours, max 75 mg/kg/day. Neonates: 10-15 mg/kg every 6-8 hours.

### Dose Adjustments
**Renal Impairment (Crcl 10-50 Ml/Min):**
Every 6 hours; CrCl <10 mL/min: every 8 hours

**Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh B/C):**
Maximum 2000 mg/day

**Elderly (>65 Years):**
Start 500 mg/dose; monitor for dehydration

**Chronic Alcoholics:**
Maximum 2000 mg/day

**Malnutrition/Obesity:**
Use ideal body weight for dosing

## 🔗 Interactions

### 💊 Drug-Drug Interactions

#### 🟡 Warfarin (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Paracetamol inhibits warfarin metabolism (CYP2C9) and displaces from albumin.

**Clinical Effect:** Elevated INR, bleeding risk.

**Management:** Monitor INR frequently; limit paracetamol to <2000 mg/day.

**Evidence Level:** strong


#### 🔴 Chronic alcohol (SEVERE)

**Mechanism:** Alcohol induces CYP2E1, increasing NAPQI formation; depletes glutathione.

**Clinical Effect:** Hepatotoxicity at therapeutic doses.

**Management:** Limit to 2000 mg/day; counsel abstinence.

**Evidence Level:** strong


#### 🟡 Carbamazepine (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Enzyme induction (CYP3A4/CYP2E1) reduces paracetamol levels.

**Clinical Effect:** Decreased efficacy; risk compensatory overuse.

**Management:** Monitor efficacy; may need dose increase.

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟢 Metoclopramide (MINOR)

**Mechanism:** Accelerates gastric emptying, enhancing absorption.

**Clinical Effect:** Faster onset, higher peak levels.

**Management:** No adjustment needed; monitor for efficacy.

**Evidence Level:** moderate

### 🍎 Food & Lifestyle Interactions

#### High-fat meals

**Mechanism:** Delays gastric emptying.

**Clinical Effect:** Tmax delayed 0.5-1 hour; no change in AUC.

**Management:** Administer 30 min before meals if rapid onset needed.

#### Alcohol (acute/chronic)

**Mechanism:** Synergistic hepatotoxicity via glutathione depletion.

**Clinical Effect:** Elevated ALT/AST even at 2000 mg/day.

**Management:** Avoid concurrent use; separate by >6 hours if unavoidable.

### Environmental Considerations

- Store at <25°C in tight container; protect from moisture/light.
- Discard if solution discolors (IV prep).
- Avoid freezing oral liquids; shake suspensions well.
- Not for use in extreme heat/humidity without stability data.

## ⚠️ Safety Profile

### 🚨 BLACK BOX WARNINGS

1. Severe liver injury may occur with therapeutic doses exceeding 4000 mg/day or lower in risk factors (alcohol, malnutrition); check total daily dose from all sources.

2. Overdosage (>7.5-10 g acute) risks fulminant hepatic failure requiring transplant; antidotal therapy with N-acetylcysteine within 8-24 hours critical.

3. Risk increased 3-4 fold with chronic alcohol use (>3 drinks/day).

### Adverse Effects

**Common (>10%):**
- Nausea (3-5%)
- Vomiting (2-4%)
- Rash (1-2%)
- Pruritus (1%)
- Dizziness (<1%)

**Serious (Any Frequency):**
- Acute hepatotoxicity (overdose)
- Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Metabolic acidosis (high-dose IV)
- Thrombocytopenia (rare)

## 💡 Recommendations

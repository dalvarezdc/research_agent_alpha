## Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, specifically blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor (A) site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein s...

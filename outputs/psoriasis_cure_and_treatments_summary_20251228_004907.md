## 🔬 Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-28 00:48:26
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder with no known cure. Standard treatments include topical agents (corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues), phototherapy, systemic medications (methotrexate,...
- Counter Narrative: Alternative approaches claim potential cures or remission through dietary changes (e.g., anti-inflammatory, gluten-free, Pagano diet), gut microbiome modulation, detoxification, herbal remedies (e.g.,...
- Key Conflicts: Official view prioritizes FDA-approved treatments with clinical trial evidence but acknowledges high relapse rates and side effects (e.g., immunosuppression risks); counter claims lack rigorous RCTs, ...

### Phase 2: Evidence Stress Test

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-28 00:48:35
**User Choice:** Proceed

**Key Findings:**
- Industry Funded Studies: High-quality RCTs and meta-analyses, primarily funded by pharmaceutical entities (e.g., Novartis, Janssen), support biologics (IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors like secukinumab, guselkumab) and systemic agents ...
- Independent Research: Sparse; small-scale studies on dietary interventions (e.g., gluten-free, Mediterranean diets) and probiotics show minor symptom relief (e.g., SCORAD reductions), but no RCTs confirm cure or remission;...
- Methodology Quality: Official treatments: Excellent (double-blind RCTs, n>1000, long-term data, CONSORT-compliant). Counter-narrative: Poor (observational, n<100, no blinding, high attrition, publication bias risk).
- Anecdotal Signals: Abundant self-reports of remission via Pagano diet, elimination protocols (gluten/dairy-free), Oregon grape, and stress reduction on forums (e.g., Reddit, patient sites); unverified, susceptible to se...
- Time Weighted Evidence: Decades of data (1970s-present) affirm chronicity and management efficacy; recent biologics (post-2010) optimize control but confirm no cure; alternative claims static, unproven over time.

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-28 00:48:43
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**

- Industry Bias: Pharmaceutical-funded RCTs (e.g., Novartis, Janssen) dominate high-quality evidence supporting biologics, while independent research on non-patentable alternatives (diets, probiotics) is sparse, metho...
- Grey Zone: Preliminary signals from anecdotes and small studies indicate possible remission via dietary protocols (Pagano, gluten/dairy-free), gut microbiome modulation, herbal remedies (Oregon grape), and stres...

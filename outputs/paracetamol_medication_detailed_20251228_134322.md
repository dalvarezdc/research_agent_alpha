## 📋 Overview

### 🧬 Drug Classification
**Drug Class:** Non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic

### 🔬 Mechanism of Action
Paracetamol selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-2) more than COX-1 in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby mediating analgesic and antipyretic effects. It exhibits weak peripheral anti-inflammatory activity compared to NSAIDs. The exact central mechanism may involve additional pathways such as serotoninergic and cannabinoid systems.

## ⚗️ Pharmacology

### Absorption
Paracetamol is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed from the small intestine after oral administration, with bioavailability of 70-90%. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within 0.5-2 hours post-dose. Food, particularly high-fat meals, may delay absorption by 0.5-1 hour without significantly altering extent.

### Distribution & Metabolism
Primarily hepatic metabolism occurs via phase II conjugation: 50-60% to paracetamol-glucuronide, 25-35% to paracetamol-sulfate, and 5-10% via CYP2E1 (minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) to the reactive intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione under normal conditions. In overdose, glutathione depletion leads to NAPQI accumulation and hepatotoxicity.

### Elimination
Elimination is predominantly renal, with 90-100% of dose excreted as metabolites in urine within 24 hours; less than 5% is excreted unchanged. Total body clearance is 350-500 mL/min in adults. Half-life prolongation occurs in renal impairment due to metabolite accumulation.

**Half-Life:** 1.5-3 hours in healthy adults; 3-8 hours in hepatic impairment; up to 10-15 hours in neonates or severe overdose.

## 💉 Clinical Use

### Approved Indications
1. Mild to moderate acute pain
2. Fever reduction
3. Symptomatic relief of common cold and influenza

### Off-Label Uses
1. Chronic osteoarthritis pain (adjunct to NSAIDs)
2. Headache prophylaxis in limited cases
3. Postoperative analgesia adjunct (moderate evidence)

### Standard Dosing
Adults and adolescents >12 years: 500-1000 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed, maximum 4000 mg/day. Children 1 month-12 years: 10-15 mg/kg/dose every 4-6 hours, maximum 75 mg/kg/day or 4000 mg/day. IV dosing: 1000 mg every 6 hours, max 4000 mg/day.

### Dose Adjustments
**Hepatic Impairment (Mild):**
Maximum 3000 mg/day; monitor LFTs.

**Hepatic Impairment (Moderate-Severe):**
Maximum 2000 mg/day or avoid; consult hepatologist.

**Renal Impairment (Crcl 10-50 Ml/Min):**
Maximum 3000 mg/day.

**Renal Impairment (Crcl <10 Ml/Min Or Dialysis):**
Maximum 2000 mg/day; dose after dialysis.

**Elderly (>65 Years):**
Start at 500 mg/dose; maximum 3000 mg/day due to reduced clearance.

**Chronic Alcoholics:**
Maximum 2000 mg/day; increased hepatotoxicity risk.

## 🔗 Interactions

### 💊 Drug-Drug Interactions

#### 🟡 Warfarin (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Paracetamol may inhibit warfarin metabolism (CYP2C9) or displace from protein binding.

**Clinical Effect:** Elevated INR, increased bleeding risk.

**Management:** Monitor INR frequently (weekly initially); consider alternative analgesic if chronic use.

**Evidence Level:** moderate


#### 🟡 Probenecid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Probenecid inhibits glucuronidation and renal excretion of paracetamol.

**Clinical Effect:** Increased paracetamol levels and half-life.

**Management:** Reduce paracetamol dose by 50%; monitor for toxicity.

**Evidence Level:** limited


#### 🔴 Alcohol (chronic use) (SEVERE)

**Mechanism:** Induction of CYP2E1 increases NAPQI production; glutathione depletion.

**Clinical Effect:** Enhanced hepatotoxicity risk even at therapeutic doses.

**Management:** Avoid concurrent use or limit paracetamol to 2 g/day; counsel on abstinence.

**Evidence Level:** strong


#### 🟡 Isoniazid (MODERATE)

**Mechanism:** Induction of CYP2E1 increases NAPQI formation.

**Clinical Effect:** Potential hepatotoxicity.

**Management:** Monitor LFTs; use lowest effective dose.

**Evidence Level:** moderate

### 🍎 Food & Lifestyle Interactions

#### High-fat meals

**Mechanism:** Delayed gastric emptying reduces absorption rate.

**Clinical Effect:** Delayed time to peak concentration (Tmax increased by 0.5-1 hour); no change in AUC.

**Management:** No dose adjustment; administer without regard to meals.

#### Alcohol (acute ingestion)

**Mechanism:** Acute alcohol inhibits CYP2E1, but chronic induces it; variable glutathione effects.

**Clinical Effect:** Unpredictable hepatotoxicity risk.

**Management:** Separate by >4 hours if possible; avoid in chronic users.

### Environmental Considerations

- Store below 25°C (77°F), protected from light and moisture to maintain stability.
- Avoid freezing IV formulations; discard if discolored or particulate.
- Proper disposal of unused medication via take-back programs to prevent aquatic contamination by metabolites.

## ⚠️ Safety Profile

### 🚨 BLACK BOX WARNINGS

1. Severe liver injury may occur with therapeutic doses (>4000 mg/day) or overdose; acute liver failure can lead to transplantation or death.

2. Do not exceed recommended dose; multiple products may contain paracetamol leading to inadvertent overdose.

### Adverse Effects

**Common (>10%):**
- Nausea (3-5%)
- Vomiting (1-3%)
- Rash (1-2%)
- Pruritus
- Dizziness

**Serious (Any Frequency):**
- Acute hepatotoxicity (overdose >150 mg/kg)
- Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare)
- Metabolic acidosis (high-dose IV)

## 💡 Recommendations

### ✅ What TO DO:

#### 1. Recommendation 1

**Action:** Educate on total intake from all sources (e.g., combination products).

**Why:** Reduces risk of hepatotoxicity based on pharmacokinetic data and overdose epidemiology.

**Evidence Level:** strong

**Expected Outcome:** Safe analgesia with <0.01% hepatotoxicity incidence.

**Monitoring:** Query for symptoms if >3 g/day.

#### 2. Recommendation 2

**Action:** IV NAC 150 mg/kg over 1 hour, then 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours.

**Why:** Replenishes glutathione to detoxify NAPQI; Rumack-Matthew nomogram guides need.

**Evidence Level:** strong

**Expected Outcome:** Hepatotoxicity prevention if initiated early (>90% efficacy).

**Monitoring:** Serum paracetamol levels at 4 hours post-ingestion; LFTs.

#### 3. Recommendation 3

**Action:** AUDIT-C questionnaire; cap at 2000 mg/day if positive.

**Why:** CYP2E1 induction increases NAPQI; limited evidence supports dose cap.

**Evidence Level:** moderate

**Expected Outcome:** Minimized liver injury risk.

**Monitoring:** Baseline and monthly LFTs.

### ❌ What NOT TO DO:

#### 1. Do not combine multiple paracetamol-containing products without dose calculation.

#### 2. Do not use long-term (>14 days) without LFT monitoring.

#### 3. Do not administer to patients with G6PD deficiency routinely.

### 🧯 Debunked Claims:

#### ❌ 1. Paracetamol is completely safe with no risk of liver damage at any dose.

**Why Debunked:** Therapeutic misadventure causes 50% of acute liver failure cases.

**Evidence Against:** FDA labeling, Rumack nomogram trials, AASLD guidelines.

**Debunked By:** NEJM reviews (2000s overdose data)

**Why Harmful:** Encourages overdose, delaying care.

#### ❌ 2. Paracetamol cures the common cold or flu.

**Why Debunked:** Symptomatic relief only; no antiviral activity.

**Evidence Against:** Cochrane reviews show no reduction in duration.

**Debunked By:** RCTs (e.g., 2013 meta-analysis)

**Why Harmful:** Delays seeking care for complications.

#### ❌ 3. Daily paracetamol prevents hangovers.

**Why Debunked:** No prophylactic efficacy; increases hepatotoxicity with alcohol.

**Evidence Against:** Small trials show no benefit over placebo.

**Debunked By:** Pharmacoepidemiology studies

**Why Harmful:** Promotes unsafe alcohol-paracetamol pairing.

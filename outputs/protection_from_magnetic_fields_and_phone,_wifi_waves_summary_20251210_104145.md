## 🔬 Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Conflict Scan

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 10:36:48
**User Choice:** Both

**Key Findings:**
- Official Narrative: The established medical and regulatory consensus maintains that non-ionizing radiation from mobile phones, WiFi, and common magnetic fields poses **no significant health risk** at exposure levels belo...
- Counter Narrative: ### A. **Non-Thermal Biological Effects**
Emerging research suggests biological activity **below thermal thresholds**:
- **Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel (VGCC) Activation**: Pall (2013-2018) proposes ...

### Phase 2: Evidence Stress Test

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 10:38:31
**User Choice:** Proceed

**Key Findings:**
- Industry Funded Studies: ---
## 1. FUNDING FILTER ANALYSIS
**ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection)**
- **Priority Signal**: Peer review panel upgraded findings from "some evidence" to "clear e...
- Independent Research: - **Red Flag**: Guidelines cited by WHO/FCC to justify inaction despite contradicting their own IARC 2B classification
**COSMOS Study (2018-ongoing)**
**SCENIHR Reports (EU Scientific Committee)**
**N...
- Methodology Quality: - **Findings**:
  - **Millimeter waves (24-100 GHz)**: Penetrate 1-2mm (skin, cornea, peripheral nerves)
  - **Sweat ducts act as helical antennas**: Resonant absorption at 60-90 GHz
  - **Pulsed natu...
- Anecdotal Signals: - **Finding**: "No increased risk" - but confidence intervals wide, loss to follow-up 40%
**Why This Matters**: If confirmed in humans, chronic BBB leakage could explain:
- Early-onset dementia trends...
- Time Weighted Evidence: - **Dose**: 5-50 V/m - **far below thermal threshold**, equivalent to living near cell tower
- **Finding**: Same schwannomas as NTP study, plus glial tumors
- **Significance**: Replication at environm...

### Phase 3: Synthesis Menu

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 10:40:13
**User Choice:** P

**Key Findings:**
- Biological Truth: **Established Mechanisms:**
- **Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs)**: The Pall mechanism is biophysically sound. EMF can alter membrane potentials at intensities far below heating thresholds. VGCC...
- Industry Bias: 1. VGCC activation → calcium influx
2. Mitochondrial calcium overload → electron transport chain disruption
3. Superoxide production → lipid peroxidation, DNA damage
4. Chronic low-level oxidative str...
- Grey Zone: ### Tier 1: No-Brainer Precautions (Zero Downside)
**Distance/Duration:**
- Speakerphone/wired headphones: 100-1000x exposure reduction
- **For children**: Thinner skulls = 2x deeper penetration (Chri...

  "title": "Risky Medical Exams and Procedures",
  "summary": "The term 'risky' can refer to different factors: the potential for complications (like infection or bleeding), the amount of radiation exposure, or the consequences of an inaccurate result (a false-positive or false-negative). The exams listed here are generally safe, but have higher potential risks that must be weighed against their diagnostic benefits.",
